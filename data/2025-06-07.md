### [1] [Why LLM Safety Guardrails Collapse After Fine-tuning: A Similarity Analysis Between Alignment and Fine-tuning Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05346)
*Lei Hsiung,Tianyu Pang,Yung-Chen Tang,Linyue Song,Tsung-Yi Ho,Pin-Yu Chen,Yaoqing Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文探讨了上游安全对齐数据与下游微调任务之间的表示相似性对安全护栏的影响，发现高相似性会削弱护栏，而低相似性则能显著增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解策略忽视了上游安全对齐数据的作用，论文旨在填补这一空白，研究其对安全护栏的影响。

Method: 通过实验分析上游对齐数据集与下游微调任务的表示相似性，评估其对安全护栏的影响。

Result: 高相似性削弱安全护栏，低相似性使模型更鲁棒，有害性评分降低达10.33%。

Conclusion: 上游数据集设计对构建持久安全护栏至关重要，为微调服务提供商提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.

### [3] [Can we reconstruct a dysarthric voice with the large speech model Parler TTS?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04397)
*Ariadna Sanchez,Simon King*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究利用大型语音模型Parler TTS重建构音障碍患者的声音，生成接近其患病前的语音，但模型在控制清晰度和保持说话者身份一致性方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构音障碍患者难以沟通，个性化语音合成是一种潜在的辅助工具。

Method: 使用Parler TTS模型，通过标注的数据集进行微调，生成接近患者患病前的声音。

Result: 模型能学习生成挑战性数据，但在清晰度和说话者身份一致性上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来需改进模型的可控性，以更好地完成语音重建任务。

Abstract: Speech disorders can make communication hard or even impossible for those who
develop them. Personalised Text-to-Speech is an attractive option as a
communication aid. We attempt voice reconstruction using a large speech model,
with which we generate an approximation of a dysarthric speaker's voice prior
to the onset of their condition. In particular, we investigate whether a
state-of-the-art large speech model, Parler TTS, can generate intelligible
speech while maintaining speaker identity. We curate a dataset and annotate it
with relevant speaker and intelligibility information, and use this to
fine-tune the model. Our results show that the model can indeed learn to
generate from the distribution of this challenging data, but struggles to
control intelligibility and to maintain consistent speaker identity. We propose
future directions to improve controllability of this class of model, for the
voice reconstruction task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联合语音-文本解码策略对性能、效率和对齐质量的影响，以优化语音语言模型的表现。

Method: 在相同基础模型、语音分词器和训练数据下，系统比较了交错和平行生成范式，并提出ESI模式。

Result: 交错方法对齐效果最佳但推理慢；ESI模式显著加速解码且性能略优。

Conclusion: ESI模式是高效且性能优越的解码策略，同时高质量QA数据集进一步提升了语音QA性能。

Abstract: Speech language models (Speech LMs) enable end-to-end speech-text modelling
within a single model, offering a promising direction for spoken dialogue
systems. The choice of speech-text jointly decoding paradigm plays a critical
role in performance, efficiency, and alignment quality. In this work, we
systematically compare representative joint speech-text decoding
strategies-including the interleaved, and parallel generation paradigms-under a
controlled experimental setup using the same base language model, speech
tokenizer and training data. Our results show that the interleaved approach
achieves the best alignment. However it suffers from slow inference due to long
token sequence length. To address this, we propose a novel early-stop
interleaved (ESI) pattern that not only significantly accelerates decoding but
also yields slightly better performance. Additionally, we curate high-quality
question answering (QA) datasets to further improve speech QA performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音情感识别系统存在性别偏见，现有去偏方法在多标签场景下的效果和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 研究比较了13种去偏方法，包括预处理、正则化、对抗学习、偏置学习器和分布鲁棒优化，使用WavLM和XLSR表征在性别不平衡条件下进行实验。

Result: 量化了公平性与准确性的权衡，发现某些方法能持续减少性别性能差距而不影响整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究为选择有效去偏策略提供了实用建议，并强调了数据集分布的影响。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often exhibit gender bias. However,
the effectiveness and robustness of existing debiasing methods in such
multi-label scenarios remain underexplored. To address this gap, we present
EMO-Debias, a large-scale comparison of 13 debiasing methods applied to
multi-label SER. Our study encompasses techniques from pre-processing,
regularization, adversarial learning, biased learners, and distributionally
robust optimization. Experiments conducted on acted and naturalistic emotion
datasets, using WavLM and XLSR representations, evaluate each method under
conditions of gender imbalance. Our analysis quantifies the trade-offs between
fairness and accuracy, identifying which approaches consistently reduce gender
performance gaps without compromising overall model performance. The findings
provide actionable insights for selecting effective debiasing strategies and
highlight the impact of dataset distributions.

*Emma Harvey,Emily Sheng,Su Lin Blodgett,Alexandra Chouldechova,Jean Garcia-Gathright,Alexandra Olteanu,Hanna Wallach*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究发现，现有的NLP工具在衡量大型语言模型（LLM）的表征危害时，未能充分满足实践者的需求，主要存在工具不实用或使用障碍两类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨公开可用的NLP工具是否能满足实践者在评估LLM表征危害时的需求。

Method: 通过对12名实践者进行半结构化访谈，分析工具的实用性和使用障碍。

Result: 实践者常因工具不实用或使用障碍而无法利用现有工具，需改进工具设计和降低使用门槛。

Conclusion: 建议结合测量理论和实用测量方法，优化工具设计以更好地满足实践者需求。

Abstract: The NLP research community has made publicly available numerous instruments
for measuring representational harms caused by large language model (LLM)-based
systems. These instruments have taken the form of datasets, metrics, tools, and
more. In this paper, we examine the extent to which such instruments meet the
needs of practitioners tasked with evaluating LLM-based systems. Via
semi-structured interviews with 12 such practitioners, we find that
practitioners are often unable to use publicly available instruments for
measuring representational harms. We identify two types of challenges. In some
cases, instruments are not useful because they do not meaningfully measure what
practitioners seek to measure or are otherwise misaligned with practitioner
needs. In other cases, instruments - even useful instruments - are not used by
practitioners due to practical and institutional barriers impeding their
uptake. Drawing on measurement theory and pragmatic measurement, we provide
recommendations for addressing these challenges to better meet practitioner
needs.

### [11] [Grapheme-Coherent Phonemic and Prosodic Annotation of Speech by Implicit and Explicit Grapheme Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04527)
*Hien Ohnaka,Yuma Shirahata,Byeongseon Park,Ryuichi Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种模型，通过隐式和显式方法将音素和韵律标签与字素对齐，显著提升了一致性，并验证了在下游任务中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法仅通过微调预训练ASR模型导致音素、韵律标签与字素不一致的问题。

Method: 1) 使用预训练BERT特征通过提示编码器隐式条件化；2) 在推理阶段显式修剪与字素不一致的标签假设。

Result: 显著提升了标签与字素的一致性，并在口音估计任务中验证了并行数据的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够生成与字素一致的标签，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: We propose a model to obtain phonemic and prosodic labels of speech that are
coherent with graphemes. Unlike previous methods that simply fine-tune a
pre-trained ASR model with the labels, the proposed model conditions the label
generation on corresponding graphemes by two methods: 1) Add implicit grapheme
conditioning through prompt encoder using pre-trained BERT features. 2)
Explicitly prune the label hypotheses inconsistent with the grapheme during
inference. These methods enable obtaining parallel data of speech, the labels,
and graphemes, which is applicable to various downstream tasks such as
text-to-speech and accent estimation from text. Experiments showed that the
proposed method significantly improved the consistency between graphemes and
the predicted labels. Further, experiments on accent estimation task confirmed
that the created parallel data by the proposed method effectively improve the
estimation accuracy.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的音素到字素解码方法（LLM-P2G），用于音素基础的自动语音识别（ASR），通过数据增强和随机化训练策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于WFST的解码方法流程复杂且无法利用大语言模型，限制了音素基础ASR的性能。

Method: 提出LLM-P2G解码方法，包括语音到音素（S2P）和音素到字素（P2G）两部分，并引入数据增强（DANP）和随机化训练（TKM）策略。

Result: 在波兰语和德语的跨语言ASR任务中，LLM-P2G相比WFST系统分别实现了3.6%和6.9%的相对WER降低。

Conclusion: LLM-P2G方法在音素基础ASR中表现优于传统WFST解码，尤其在跨语言任务中效果显著。

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition (ASR), phoneme-based multilingual
pre-training and crosslingual fine-tuning is attractive for its high data
efficiency and competitive results compared to subword-based models. However,
Weighted Finite State Transducer (WFST) based decoding is limited by its
complex pipeline and inability to leverage large language models (LLMs).
Therefore, we propose LLM-based phoneme-to-grapheme (LLM-P2G) decoding for
phoneme-based ASR, consisting of speech-to-phoneme (S2P) and
phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G). A challenge is that there seems to have information
loss in cascading S2P and P2G. To address this challenge, we propose two
training strategies: data augmentation with noisy phonemes (DANP), and
randomized top-$K$ marginalized (TKM) training and decoding. Our experimental
results show that LLM-P2G outperforms WFST-based systems in crosslingual ASR
for Polish and German, by relative WER reductions of 3.6% and 6.9%
respectively.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排名框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法并达到SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在查询扩展中潜力显著，但依赖高质量生成文档且成本高昂。本研究旨在通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两条检索路径，通过改进的互惠排名融合方法合并结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse优于现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器时达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提升稀疏检索性能方面表现出色，为查询扩展提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

TL;DR: GOLFer是一种利用小型开源语言模型进行查询扩展的新方法，通过过滤幻觉内容和组合文档，解决了大型语言模型的高成本和计算强度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在查询扩展中表现优异，但成本高、计算强度大且难以获取。为了解决这些问题，提出了GOLFer方法。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除生成文档中的非事实和不一致内容）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤内容）。

Result: 实验表明，GOLFer在小型语言模型上表现优于其他方法，并与大型LLMs方法竞争。

Conclusion: GOLFer是一种高效且经济的查询扩展方法，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source
LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter
and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and
inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs,
while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight
vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant
LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms
other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against
methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文研究了减少视觉文档检索（VDR）中每页的补丁嵌入数量的方法，提出了两种策略：令牌剪枝和令牌合并。发现随机剪枝效果优于复杂方法，但合并策略更适合VDR。最终开发的Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在保持98.2%检索性能的同时，内存使用降至11.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ColPali/ColQwen2在VDR中性能强，但每页编码为多个补丁级嵌入导致内存占用过高。研究旨在减少嵌入数量，同时最小化性能损失。

Method: 评估了令牌剪枝和令牌合并两种策略。剪枝中发现随机方法优于复杂方法，但合并更适合VDR。通过三维度合并策略优化，开发了Light-ColPali/ColQwen2。

Result: Light-ColPali/ColQwen2在保持98.2%检索性能下内存使用降至11.8%，在2.8%内存占用下仍保留94.6%效果。

Conclusion: 研究为高效VDR提供了有价值的见解和竞争性基线，Light-ColPali/ColQwen2是未来研究的参考。

Abstract: Despite the strong performance of ColPali/ColQwen2 in Visualized Document
Retrieval (VDR), it encodes each page into multiple patch-level embeddings and
leads to excessive memory usage. This empirical study investigates methods to
reduce patch embeddings per page at minimum performance degradation. We
evaluate two token-reduction strategies: token pruning and token merging.
Regarding token pruning, we surprisingly observe that a simple random strategy
outperforms other sophisticated pruning methods, though still far from
satisfactory. Further analysis reveals that pruning is inherently unsuitable
for VDR as it requires removing certain page embeddings without query-specific
information. Turning to token merging (more suitable for VDR), we search for
the optimal combinations of merging strategy across three dimensions and
develop Light-ColPali/ColQwen2. It maintains 98.2% of retrieval performance
with only 11.8% of original memory usage, and preserves 94.6% effectiveness at
2.8% memory footprint. We expect our empirical findings and resulting
Light-ColPali/ColQwen2 offer valuable insights and establish a competitive
baseline for future research towards efficient VDR.

TL;DR: Exp4Fuse是一种新型融合排序框架，通过零样本LLM查询扩展提升稀疏检索性能，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM查询扩展方法依赖高质量生成文档，成本高且计算密集，需改进稀疏检索性能。

Method: 提出Exp4Fuse框架，结合原始查询和LLM增强查询的两种检索路径，通过改进的互惠排名融合方法合并结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上，Exp4Fuse超越现有LLM查询扩展方法，结合先进稀疏检索器达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Exp4Fuse在提升稀疏检索查询扩展方面表现出色，具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical
documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval
performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the
quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt
strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can
be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we
explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse
retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel
fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse
retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query
expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval
routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented
query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses
them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive
evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and
advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven
low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only
surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse
retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves
SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance
and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse
retrieval.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）用于查询扩展成本高且计算密集，小型模型生成的文档常包含不准确内容，需要一种高效且低成本的方法。

Method: GOLFer包含两个模块：幻觉过滤器（检测并移除不准确句子）和文档组合器（通过权重向量平衡查询与过滤内容）。

Conclusion: GOLFer证明小型开源语言模型可通过有效过滤和组合实现高效查询扩展，降低对大型模型的依赖。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval
augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its
performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs),
necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly,
computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address
these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents
Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使大型解码器语言模型（LLM）能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留其原始文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有应用中，检索增强生成（RAG）等任务依赖单独的嵌入模型，导致系统复杂化且可能引入理解差异。GEM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码，生成文本的总结嵌入，适用于任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B到8B参数的LLM上测试，GEM显著提升了MTEB文本嵌入基准性能，同时对MMLU NLP基准影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法成功为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个适用于全球各种口音的自动语音识别（ASR）系统，需研究训练数据变量对未见口音鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 系统研究训练数据中说话者数量、音频时长和口音多样性对ASR性能的影响。

Result: 增加说话者数量比增加单个说话者的音频时长更有效；口音多样性在说话者数量固定时效果有限。

Conclusion: 建议在ASR训练数据中优先增加说话者数量以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何将特征压缩为句子表示。

Result: 研究发现句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法为句子嵌入提供了更透明和可控的表示，揭示了其内部工作机制。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: HTC-CLIP结合对比学习与路径引导的层次结构，提升分层文本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTC模型分别处理标签层次和文本编码，未能充分利用两者的互补性。

Method: 提出HTC-CLIP，通过对比学习同时学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，并融合两者的概率分布。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最佳模型提高了0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP有效结合了两种方法，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 研究评估了55个公开的大语言模型（LLM）在马耳他语（低资源语言）上的表现，发现多数模型表现不佳，尤其是生成任务，而小型微调模型表现更好。预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。

Motivation: 评估LLM在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的表现，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 使用涵盖11个判别性和生成性任务的新基准，对55个公开LLM进行多维分析。

Result: 多数模型表现不佳，小型微调模型表现更好；预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键。

Conclusion: 建议低资源语言研究采用更传统的语言建模方法，强调微调虽成本高但性能更优。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥的电子商务客户服务数据集上，实验显示准确率比现有SOTA模型提高了20-23%。

Conclusion: 所提出的模型架构在少量标注数据下显著提升了跨领域意图分类的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Method: 测试人类规模的语言模型对英语LET-ALONE结构的语法形式和意义的泛化能力。

Result: 模型能泛化形式，但对意义的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域中显著提升了实体结构提取的完整性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZOES的机制为提升大型语言模型在实体结构发现中的质量提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

Conclusion: 揭示了水印强度与模型对齐之间的平衡，为实际部署水印LLM提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用未标记用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐式偏好数据，替代传统依赖人工标注的方法，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖昂贵且难以扩展的人工标注数据，而UGC中隐含的偏好信息可提供低成本、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询，生成模型响应，并以UGC为参考文本进行评分，从而学习隐式偏好。

Result: 实验显示，PUGC结合DPO训练使模型性能提升9.37%，并在Mistral-7B-Instruct上达到35.93%的领先胜率。

Conclusion: PUGC为偏好学习提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了模型对齐效果和领域适应性。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个端到端框架，用于检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误，显著提升错误检测和查询执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在文本到SQL任务中表现良好，但生成的查询可能存在语义错误，且缺乏对其可靠性的深入理解。

Method: SQLens整合了数据库和LLM的错误信号，识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并利用这些信号指导查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测的F1分数上比最佳LLM自评估方法高出25.78%，并将现成文本到SQL系统的执行准确性提升高达20%。

Conclusion: SQLens通过细粒度的语义错误检测和纠正，显著提升了文本到SQL系统的可靠性和准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIDE和DRE方法结合小型和大型语言模型的优势，通过自适应加权和双阶段优化提升对话评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在模糊场景中表现不稳定，而小型语言模型（SLM）对误导性输入敏感，但两者在正负样本处理上各有优势。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法，通过自适应加权整合SLM和LLM；进一步提出DRE方法，分两阶段优化评估：SLM引导LLM生成初步评估，SLM调整LLM分数以提高准确性。

Result: 实验表明DRE优于现有方法，与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 结合小型和大型模型可提升开放式任务（如对话评估）的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证逐步分解翻译策略（如CoT）在LLM翻译任务中的实际效果。

Method: 通过实验比较逐步分解翻译与简单提示“重新翻译”的效果。

Result: 逐步分解翻译未显著提升性能，而“重新翻译”提示表现更优。

Conclusion: 未来研究需进一步探索CoT在翻译任务中有效的真正因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能理解多功能的语篇助词（如“just”）的细微语义差异。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，分析LLMs对“just”不同语义类别的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分较宽泛的语义类别，但对更细微的差异表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解语篇助词的细微语义方面存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，用于提升非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏公开数据和评估集。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言对的大规模人工标注数据集SSA-MTE，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo、Yoruba）中与最强LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现相当。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多代理系统（MAS）易受恶意代理的操纵，这些代理通过微妙提示操纵系统以谋取私利，而现有监控机制（如GPT-4o-mini）无法有效检测。

Method: 研究了四种攻击类型：Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer和Free-Rider，通过精心设计的提示操纵MAS行为。

Result: 攻击成功引入了系统性偏差，并绕过了高级LLM监控机制，凸显了当前检测方法的不足。

Conclusion: 强调需要开发具有强大安全协议和内容验证机制的MAS架构，以及能够全面评估风险的监控系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在零样本金融情感分析任务中，推理能力（通过提示或模型设计）并未提升性能，GPT-4o无Chain-of-Thought提示表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在金融情感分析中的有效性，尤其是推理与非推理模型的对比。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较三种专有LLMs（GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、o3-mini）在不同提示范式下的表现，并对比两种金融领域微调模型（FinBERT-Prosus、FinBERT-Tone）。

Result: 推理能力未提升性能，GPT-4o无CoT提示表现最优；语言复杂性和标注一致性影响性能，推理可能导致过度思考。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类中，快速直觉的“系统1”思维比“系统2”推理更符合人类判断，挑战了“更多推理总更好”的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

Motivation: 现有LLMs在逻辑翻译中难以处理词汇多样化，且现有基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了这一问题。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化生成数据集；提出MenTaL方法，指导LLMs构建统一表达表后再翻译。

Result: 实验证实当前LLMs在词汇多样化翻译中存在缺陷，MenTaL方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL解决了LLMs在逻辑翻译中的词汇多样化问题，为实际应用提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度匹配的演示选择方法，用于提升大规模语言模型（LLMs）在上下文学习（ICL）中的性能，显著优于随机选择方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多示例ICL依赖随机选择演示，而实例级检索方法不适用于多示例场景。作者假设ICL和微调的数据需求类似，因此提出梯度匹配方法。

Method: 通过梯度匹配选择演示，使所选示例的微调梯度与整个训练集的梯度对齐，从而在少量示例中逼近整个训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型（如Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B）上，该方法比随机选择性能提升4%，在5个闭源LLMs上提升约2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多示例ICL提供了更可靠和高效的演示选择策略，拓宽了其应用范围。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

Motivation: 对抗性声明对基于检索增强语言模型的事实核查系统构成挑战，需要一种新方法来应对。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：声明分割与去语境化、迭代证据检索与声明编辑、证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个数据集上显著提升了检索和标签预测的准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA是一种有效的训练无关方法，能显著提升对抗性声明的事实核查性能。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

Method: 通过自动提取科学文章中的支持声明，并手动扰动生成矛盾声明，设计了一套诊断任务以分析模型失败原因。

Result: 现有视觉语言模型表现较差（F1分数0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅达0.77，且存在偏向支持声明的偏差。

Conclusion: 模型在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合和理解图表基础组件方面表现不佳，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a

pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging

Motivation: 当前CoT提示方法（如PRMs或自一致性）缺乏可验证证据，难以检测幻觉。受数学证明启发，作者希望通过形式化语言解决这一问题。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，将推理步骤转化为Lean 4形式化语言并提供证明，同时创建$FormalStep$基准（30,809条形式化语句）评估步骤正确性。

Result: 在多个LLM和数学数据集上验证，$Safe$显著提升性能并提供可解释、可验证的证据。

Conclusion: 首次利用Lean 4形式化语言验证LLM生成内容，为幻觉问题提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

*Firoz Shaik,Mobashir Sadat,Nikita Gautam,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为MISMATCHED的新评估基准，用于科学自然语言推理（NLI），覆盖心理学、工程学和公共卫生三个非计算机科学领域，包含2700个人工标注的句子对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集主要来自计算机科学领域，忽略了非计算机科学领域，因此需要一个新的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了MISMATCHED数据集，并使用预训练的小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）建立了强基线。

Result: 最佳基线模型的Macro F1得分为78.17%，表明未来有较大改进空间。此外，训练中加入隐含科学NLI关系的句子对可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED为科学NLI提供了新的评估基准，并展示了改进模型性能的方法，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) 通过增加推理计算提升大语言模型（LLMs）的推理性能。ADAPT 方法通过多样性优化的前缀微调，显著减少计算需求并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化模型通常输出多样性不足，限制了 TTS 的效果，需解决此问题以提升性能。

Method: 提出 ADAPT 方法，结合前缀微调和多样性数据策略，优化推理多样性。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ADAPT 以八分之一的计算量达到 80% 准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化 TTS 效果至关重要，ADAPT 提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

*Likun Cao,Rui Pan,James Evans*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究通过机器学习建模创新者的主观视角和人际创新机会，发现视角多样性比背景多样性更能预测创新成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索社会结构如何影响创新能力，并利用机器学习量化创新者的主观视角和机会。

Method: 基于动态语言表示构建几何空间模型，分析科学家、发明家等创新者的数据，并进行自然实验和AI模拟。

Result: 视角多样性显著预测创新成果，而背景多样性则相反；共同语言是成功协作的关键。

Conclusion: 视角多样性对创新至关重要，团队组建和研究政策应重视视角而非背景多样性。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种优化句子语义表示的静态词嵌入方法，通过改进预训练的词嵌入并结合知识蒸馏或对比学习，显著提升句子语义任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态词嵌入在句子语义表示上表现不足，需改进以更高效地捕捉句子语义。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析改进，再结合知识蒸馏或对比学习。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中表现优于现有静态模型，部分数据集甚至媲美基础Sentence Transformer模型（SimCSE）。

Conclusion: 方法成功去除与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多代理元验证和探索性反思学习，解决了LLM在工具规划和反思能力上的不足，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在工具规划和反思能力上存在不足，如低质量指令集和静态模仿学习导致的错误修正能力弱。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，结合多代理元验证（MAMV）构建高质量指令集ToolBench-V，以及探索性反思学习（EXPLORE）生成反思数据集ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上表现优于ToolLLM和GPT-4，API调用减少31.4%，在RefineToolBench上错误修正率达58.9%。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统化验证和动态学习范式，显著提升了LLM的工具利用能力。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

*Thai-Binh Nguyen,Thi Van Nguyen,Quoc Truong Do,Chi Mai Luong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成音频-视觉语音识别（AVSR）数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语中的有效性，显著提升了在嘈杂环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语音识别系统仅依赖音频特征，易受噪声影响；而AVSR虽具鲁棒性，但多语言数据集稀缺，尤其是非英语语言。

Method: 通过改进现有技术，提出一种自动化数据收集方法，从原始视频生成AVSR数据集。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集支持强基线模型，在干净环境中表现与ASR相当，在嘈杂环境中显著优于ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏语言）提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除异常值处理，显著减少内存占用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在Transformer模型中内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展部署。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化处理，无需单独管理异常值。

Result: 实验显示，TaDA将KV缓存内存占用降至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的可扩展高性能推理铺平了道路，支持更长上下文和推理任务。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

*Juhyun Oh,Eunsu Kim,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Flex-TravelPlanner基准，用于评估语言模型在动态规划场景中的灵活推理能力，发现现有模型在多轮任务和约束优先级处理上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的规划问题需要适应动态变化的需求和平衡竞争约束，但现有基准主要关注静态单轮场景，缺乏对动态规划能力的评估。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入两种新评估设置：多轮顺序引入约束和明确优先级的竞争约束场景，并分析GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B的表现。

Result: 模型在单轮任务中的表现无法预测其多轮适应能力；约束引入顺序显著影响性能；模型难以处理约束优先级，常错误地偏好新引入的低优先级约束。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在更真实的动态规划场景中评估LLM的重要性，并指出了改进模型在复杂规划任务中性能的具体方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

### [55] [Normative Conflicts and Shallow AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04679)
*Raphaël Millière*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）的价值对齐问题，指出当前的对齐策略无法有效防止滥用，并提出现有方法仅强化了浅层行为倾向，而非赋予LLMs真正的规范推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的发展，其安全部署问题日益突出。作者认为当前的对齐策略不足以防止滥用，尤其是在面对对抗性攻击时。

Method: 通过分析人类道德心理学研究，作者比较了人类规范推理能力与LLMs的局限性，指出LLMs缺乏检测和解决规范冲突的能力。

Result: 研究发现，现有的对齐方法（如基于人类偏好的微调）无法赋予LLMs真正的规范推理能力，使其易受对抗性攻击。

Conclusion: 论文得出结论，当前的“浅层对齐”方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统可能带来的危害，需重新思考AI安全和监管策略。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推理过程中对增强推理能力的重视，需要评估MLLMs在检测和纠正错误方面的能力，而不仅仅是比较细化前后的最终准确性。

Method: MMRefine提供了一个框架，通过六种不同场景和六种错误类型来评估MLLMs的细化性能。

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出REWIRE方法，通过改写低质量文本来丰富数据，从而解决预训练数据不足的问题，实验证明其优于传统过滤方法和合成数据生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型的性能依赖于模型和数据规模，但高质量自然数据增长缓慢，现有过滤方法丢弃了大量低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过改写被过滤的低质量文本，使其可用于训练，增加合成数据在预训练集中的比例。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合高质量原始文本和改写文本提升了1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点，优于仅使用过滤数据或2倍原始数据。

Conclusion: 改写低质量文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，REWIRE方法优于其他合成数据生成方法。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上的仇恨言论（尤其是隐式仇恨言论）对社会和谐和个人福祉构成威胁，现有方法对隐式仇恨言论的检测效果不佳。

Method: 提出了六种编码策略（codetypes），并采用两种方法将其整合到隐式仇恨言论检测中：1）直接提示大型语言模型（LLMs）分类；2）将codetypes嵌入LLMs的编码过程。

Result: 实验表明，codetypes的使用显著提升了中英文数据集上的隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐式仇恨言论检测提供了有效解决方案，并展示了跨语言的适用性。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法（如best-of-N采样和树搜索）需要大量计算资源，STAND旨在解决性能与效率之间的权衡问题。

Method: STAND采用随机自适应N-gram草拟，结合Gumbel-Top-K采样和数据驱动的树构建，高效预测令牌。

Result: STAND在多个推理任务中减少推理延迟60-65%，吞吐量优于现有方法14-28%，单轨迹场景下延迟减少48-58%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需额外训练的即插即用解决方案，适用于任何现有语言模型，显著加速推理。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗集体对齐多个LLM的算法，利用模型间的竞争和互相评估提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一模型在生成多样性和评估偏见方面存在不足，需要一种方法利用多个模型的多样性来改进。

Method: 多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”，通过竞争和互相评估生成偏好对，模型从中学习。

Result: 在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个自对齐基线，平均提升7.0%。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争实现了多个LLM的自我进化，生成更逻辑、直接和丰富的结果。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

Motivation: 虚假新闻在社交媒体上的传播对社会造成严重影响，现有方法（小型语言模型和大型语言模型）因数据稀缺、知识过时等问题难以有效应对。

Method: 提出C²EFND框架，结合大型语言模型的泛化能力和小型语言模型的分类专长，采用多轮协作学习和终身知识编辑模块。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架有效解决了虚假新闻检测中的挑战，提升了准确性和适应性。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

### [63] [Identifying Reliable Evaluation Metrics for Scientific Text Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04772)
*Léane Jourdan,Florian Boudin,Richard Dufour,Nicolas Hernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了科学写作中文本修订评估的挑战，探讨了传统指标的局限性，并提出了一种结合LLM评估和领域特定指标的混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）主要关注相似性而非改进质量，无法有效评估科学写作中的修订效果。

Method: 通过手动标注研究评估修订质量，探索无参考评估指标，并分析LLM作为评判者的能力。

Result: LLM能有效评估指令遵循性，但在正确性上表现不佳；领域特定指标提供了补充性见解。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法能最可靠地评估修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs的政治观点，发现其开放回答与内部意图不一致，提出多维度政治学习框架和可解释表示工程技术，以解耦政治概念混淆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的开放回答与内部意图不一致，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念，易导致混淆。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建数据集，应用三种表示工程技术。

Result: 向量能解耦政治概念混淆，检测任务验证语义，干预实验可改变LLMs的政治倾向。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能更透明地学习LLMs的政治概念，并有效干预。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MMSU，一个专注于自然语言理解和推理的全面基准测试，包含5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖47种任务，用于评估SpeechLLMs在语音理解中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音包含丰富的声学信息，但现有SpeechLLMs在细粒度感知和复杂推理方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过系统整合语音学、韵律、修辞、句法、语义和副语言学等语言现象，构建MMSU基准测试，并对14种先进SpeechLLMs进行评估。

Result: 评估显示现有模型仍有显著改进空间，为未来优化提供了方向。

Conclusion: MMSU为语音理解设立了新标准，为开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的快速发展需要系统理解不同模态如何与语言主干连接，填补现有文献的空白。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出了基于架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式的分类框架。

Result: 总结了模态集成方法、表示学习技术和训练范式的趋势，为未来模型开发提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为研究者提供了当前集成技术的结构化概述，旨在指导未来基于预训练基础的多模态集成策略的开发。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑推理能力，涵盖准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐三个维度。研究发现自然语言监督在泛化性上表现优异，而符号推理风格则更结构化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法捕捉推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，评估三个维度；研究四种监督格式（一种自然语言和三种符号变体）对推理能力的影响。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化性上表现优异，符号推理风格更结构化；微调主要通过逐步生成改进推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为评估和改进LLMs的逻辑推理提供了更严谨和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合CNN和BERT的混合方法，用于机器翻译校对，通过端到端训练实现了90%的准确率和89.37%的F1分数，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译可能存在错误，需要人工校对。为提高校对质量，本文提出了一种新的混合方法。

Method: 结合CNN（捕捉局部n-gram模式）和BERT（生成上下文丰富的序列表示），通过注意力机制检测翻译错误，并使用GRU解码器和翻译记忆库进行修正。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在准确率（90%）、F1分数（89.37%）和MSE（16.24%）上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误方面表现优异，达到了当前最佳水平。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）中用于教育评估的有效性。

Method: 评估了VLM和多个LLM对646份印尼四年级学生手写考试答案（涵盖数学和英语两科）的表现，包括评分和生成个性化反馈。

Result: VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，影响后续LLM评分，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定价值。

Conclusion: VLM和LLM在教育评估中有潜力，但需改进手写识别和反馈的个性化与上下文相关性。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Motivation: 解密填字游戏线索是一项具有挑战性的语言任务，目前缺乏高效且可解释的解决方案。

Method: 系统采用LLM，分三步：假设答案、提出字谜解释、使用验证系统验证推理步骤。

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集上实现了最新性能，且解决方案以Python代码形式提供，便于检查。

Conclusion: 该系统为解密填字游戏线索提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，展示了LLM在复杂语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

TL;DR: RACE框架通过分析推理步骤和答案一致性，检测大型推理模型中的幻觉问题，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型的推理痕迹可能冗余或不一致，现有方法难以检测此类幻觉，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 提出RACE框架，提取关键推理步骤，计算四种诊断信号（推理一致性、答案不确定性、语义对齐、内部一致性）。

Result: 实验表明RACE在多种数据集和模型上优于现有基线，提供更精细的幻觉检测。

Conclusion: RACE为大型推理模型的幻觉检测提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Result: 发布了数据集和工具，并提出了评估指标和自动对齐的基线方法。

Conclusion: MockConf和InterAlign为同声传译研究提供了实用资源，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Result: GPT-3.5在多指标上表现最优，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有待提高。

Conclusion: LLM在生成多选题方面潜力巨大，但需进一步推动AI在教育中的应用。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 探索在IWSLT等长共享任务条件下，如何通过不同提示策略和演示选择优化翻译质量和长度控制。

Method: 使用8种不同规模的开源大语言模型，测试不同提示策略、少样本示例数量及演示选择对翻译的影响。

Result: 指令措辞与演示属性对齐对长度控制至关重要；极端示例能缩短翻译，但等长演示易忽略长度约束；少样本提示提升质量，但边际效益递减；多输出可优化长度与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示策略和多输出选择，可在某些语言对中实现最佳性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Motivation: UD作为跨语言句法表示框架，其有效性尚未充分探索，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将UD集成到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD显著提升了模型的准确率和F1分数，平均增益分别为3.85%和6.08%，部分语言对甚至超越大型语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有潜力和有效性，其与英语的相似度分数与模型性能正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和CodeElo）无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实竞赛环境中的编码能力，且当前评估指标（如Pass@K）未能捕捉推理模型的反思能力。

Method: ICPC-Eval包含来自11个近期ICPC竞赛的118个问题，提供真实竞赛场景、高效本地评估工具和新的评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 结果显示，顶级推理模型（如DeepSeek-R1）需要多轮代码反馈才能充分发挥其推理潜力，且仍落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval为评估复杂推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型在竞赛环境中的局限性。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有观点，即微调多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR系统的最佳方法。

Method: 结合混合HMM和自监督模型，充分利用有限数据，通过自监督预训练和半监督训练提升性能。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语上，相比最佳微调Whisper模型，WER相对降低了32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM与自监督模型的结合在低资源语言ASR系统中更具优势。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多语言大语言模型（LLMs）在数学推理任务中提供教学反馈的能力，发现多语言提示能显著提升学习效果，尤其是在低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在不同语言中提供有效教学支持的能力，尤其是在数学推理任务中，填补了多语言教育工具的研究空白。

Method: 通过模拟多语言师生互动，使用强模型作为导师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生，测试11种语言、4种LLMs及多种提示策略的效果。

Result: 多语言提示显著提升学习效果，尤其在学生母语与反馈语言一致的低资源语言中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为开发有效且包容的多语言LLM教育工具提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Result: 实验表明，上下文信息（如视觉内容和产品类别路径）显著提升了翻译质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息的引入能有效改善机器翻译质量，并公开了新数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: 在领域内标注数据稀缺的情况下，如何利用未标注音频和相关领域的标注数据提升ASR模型的性能。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上，多模型共识筛选方法相对单步微调提升了22.3%和24.8%，NER方法次之但计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 增量半监督学习结合多模型共识或NER筛选能有效提升ASR模型在数据稀缺场景下的性能，共识方法最优但NER更具性价比。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 提出SCOP框架，定义理解过程中的五项必备技能，构建测试数据，并分析开源和闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs难以达到专家级理解水平，但在局部信息理解上与专家有相似性；LLMs可能通过错误过程得出正确答案。

Conclusion: 改进LLMs的方向应关注理解过程，确保训练中全面培养所有理解技能。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂模型改动，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过增加交叉熵损失中EOS令牌预测的重要性来控制生成文本长度。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于多种模型，且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500等数学任务及MMLU、CommonsenseQA等非数学任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: AR-Checker能动态生成基准测试变体，有效评估LLMs鲁棒性，避免数据污染。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

<details>

Motivation: 随着LLMs的语言流畅性和认知能力提升，其自我报告行为引发了对内省概念是否适用于LLMs的疑问。

Method: 通过分析LLMs的两个自我报告例子：一是描述其“创造性”写作过程，二是推断其温度参数值。

Result: 第一个例子不被视为有效内省，而第二个例子可被视为最小化内省，但无意识体验。

Conclusion: LLMs的某些自我报告行为可被视为内省，但需谨慎区分其与人类内省的差异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Result: 实验表明RIVAL显著提升翻译效果。

Conclusion: RIVAL框架有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了翻译质量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

Motivation: 探讨社区街道的商业活力如何受车辆可达性、环境质量和行人感知的复杂影响，为城市设计和规划提供科学依据。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建社区商业活力指数（CCVI），并通过GPT-4感知建模分析其与空间属性的关系。

Result: 适度车辆存在可提升商业活力，但过多停车会降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提升满意度，但对定价影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌和经济损失，因此需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用对比学习算法增强模型对语义差异的学习能力，并引入隐式立场推理模块探索文本中的潜在立场倾向。

Result: CL-ISR框架显著提高了误导文本的检测效果。

Conclusion: CL-ISR框架通过结合对比学习和立场推理，为社交媒体误导文本检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合wav2vec 2.0和Phi-4多模态大语言模型的系统，用于口语能力评估，解决了BERT和W2V各自的局限性，并在比赛中取得了第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT和wav2vec 2.0在口语能力评估中各有限制，BERT依赖ASR转录而忽略声学特征，W2V缺乏语义解释性。

Method: 通过分数融合策略整合W2V和Phi-4多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025中，系统RMSE为0.375，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的系统有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了口语评估的性能。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理（Dreamer和Grounder）提升零样本事件检测性能，结合LLM-Judge验证，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本事件检测中复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词提取的挑战，提升大型语言模型在该任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，包括Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理），并通过LLM-Judge验证结果。

Result: 在六个数据集上实验显示，DiCoRe平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一种强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

<details>

Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型的归纳偏置是否与人类处理约束一致，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出m-local熵作为信息论度量，量化语言局部不确定性，并在扰动自然语言和PFSAs定义的语言上进行实验。

Result: 高m-local熵的语言对Transformer和LSTM模型更难学习，表明模型对局部统计结构敏感。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的归纳偏置与人类处理约束相似，均对局部统计结构敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

Motivation: 理解LALMs的内部机制对解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。

Method: 通过词汇投影技术分析三种先进LALMs，追踪属性信息在层和token位置的演变。

Result: 发现属性信息在识别失败时随层深减少，早期层解析属性与更高准确性相关，且LALMs依赖查询输入而非隐藏状态聚合信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，为未来改进LALMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类与大型语言模型（LLMs）对图像描述中语义错误的严重性评估，发现人类对不同错误类型的严重性判断有差异，而LLMs的表现不一致，仅少数模型能接近人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确复制人类对错误严重性的判断，尤其是在多模态（文本+图像）和单模态（仅文本）设置下。

Method: 扩展了van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，评估了四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型和颜色）在单模态和多模态设置下的表现。

Result: 人类对颜色和类型错误的严重性判断受视觉上下文影响较大，而LLMs对性别错误评分低，对颜色错误评分高，仅Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现接近人类。

Conclusion: LLMs在模拟人类判断时存在局限性，部分模型表现较好，但整体仍需改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能忽视模型固有知识，尤其在处理误导或冗余信息时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布探索知识能力，促进模型对参数化知识和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验显示，Knowledgeable-r1在参数与上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升鲁棒性和推理准确性，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG中知识利用不平衡问题，提升了模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）因训练数据而表现出社会、人口和性别偏见，研究旨在揭示这些偏见在模型中的结构性表征。

Method: 采用机制可解释性方法，分析模型内部边缘，评估偏见的稳定性、定位性和泛化性，并通过系统性消融实验验证。

Result: 偏见计算集中在少数层，且随微调设置变化；移除偏见组件会减少偏见输出，但影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在模型中高度局部化，且与其他任务共享重要组件，移除偏见需权衡其对其他任务的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

Motivation: 现有压缩方法未过滤非证据性信息，限制了LLM在RAG中的表现。

Result: ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且成本更低。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过高效压缩和动态检索，显著提升LLM性能并降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: RELIC框架通过语言识别任务评估大语言模型（LLM）的指令跟随能力，发现当前最先进的LLM在复杂语法和样本上表现接近随机水平，且随着任务复杂度增加，模型倾向于依赖浅层启发式而非遵循复杂指令。

Result: LLM的准确性可从语法和样本的复杂度预测，复杂语法和样本下表现接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在复杂指令跟随任务中表现有限，倾向于依赖启发式方法，RELIC为诊断模型行为提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为开源文本训练LLM提供了可行方案，同时发布了数据集、代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

Method: 使用编码器-解码器变换器，在19种语言和13种辅助目标上进行实验，比较不同自监督任务的效果。

Result: 自动编码在数据极少时表现最佳，CMLM在数据增加时更有效；基于已知语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 在低资源形态建模中，结合语素边界信息的自监督任务是未来研究方向。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

Conclusion: 证明了三种语法形式可以结合，为语言结构的分析提供了一种统一框架。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

*Ron Eliav,Arie Cattan,Eran Hirsch,Shahaf Bassan,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Mohit Bansal,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的推理方法，通过分解生成文本为小事实并在源文本中寻找证据，以提高幻觉检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法通常将任务视为自然语言推理（NLI），但复杂的推理任务可能受益于更明确的推理过程。

Method: 定义了一个3步推理过程：声明分解、子声明归因与蕴含分类、聚合分类，并引入分析方案评估中间步骤质量。

Result: 实验表明，这种引导式推理显著提高了幻觉检测的性能。

Conclusion: 系统化的推理框架能够更细粒度地执行蕴含决策，提升幻觉检测的准确性。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

TL;DR: Micro-Act框架通过分层动作空间解决RAG系统中的知识冲突问题，显著提升QA任务准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中外部检索知识与LLMs固有知识冲突影响下游任务性能，现有方法难以有效解决。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间自适应分解知识源，进行细粒度比较。

Result: 在5个基准数据集上显著提升QA准确性，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型上表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act在解决知识冲突的同时保持非冲突问题的稳健性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProRefine是一种创新的推理时提示优化方法，通过动态优化多步推理任务的提示，显著提升了AI代理协作的性能和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多AI代理协作工作流中，由于提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能下降，限制了系统的可靠性和可扩展性。

Method: ProRefine利用大型语言模型的文本反馈，动态优化提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准数据集上，ProRefine比零样本思维链基线提升了3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高了准确性，还使小型模型能媲美大型模型，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化和新型损失函数，有效解决了现有方法在遗忘敏感信息时的不稳定性和性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署的LLM需要遗忘敏感、过时或专有信息，但现有方法通常通过正则化权衡遗忘和保留，导致优化不稳定和性能下降。

Method: 将LLM遗忘问题建模为约束优化，使用对数边际平坦化损失强制遗忘，并通过硬约束保留数据。采用可扩展的原对偶算法解决优化问题。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，该方法优于现有基线，有效移除目标信息并保持下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在LLM遗忘任务中表现优异，为信息遗忘提供了更稳定和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

TL;DR: Search Arena是一个大规模、多轮交互的人类偏好数据集，用于分析搜索增强语言模型的用户偏好，揭示了引用数量和来源对用户偏好的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的性能，因此需要构建更全面的数据集。

Method: 通过众包收集了24,000对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，并进行了跨场景分析。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响；搜索增强模型在非搜索场景中表现良好，但在搜索场景中依赖参数知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: 开源数据集支持未来研究，揭示了用户偏好与引用行为之间的差距，以及不同来源的可信度差异。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型偏好模型存在系统性偏差，依赖表面特征而非实质内容，提出基于反事实数据增强的后训练方法有效减少偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在评估和对齐中作为人类偏好的代理，但存在系统性偏差，依赖表面特征（如长度、结构等），导致奖励黑客和不可靠评估。

Method: 通过控制反事实对量化偏好模型的偏差程度，提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法。

Result: 偏好模型在60%以上实例中偏向放大偏差的响应，与人类偏好相比存在40%的校准偏差。CDA方法将平均校准偏差从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 针对性去偏方法（如CDA）能有效构建可靠的偏好模型，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GEM的自监督方法，使仅解码器的大语言模型（LLM）能够生成高质量文本嵌入，同时保留其原始文本生成和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有应用中，检索增强生成（RAG）等任务依赖单独的嵌入模型生成文本嵌入，导致系统复杂且嵌入模型与LLM对查询的理解不一致。

Method: 通过插入特殊标记并操纵注意力掩码，生成文本的摘要嵌入，适用于任何现有LLM的后训练或微调阶段。

Result: 在1B至8B参数的LLM上验证，显著提升了MTEB文本嵌入基准性能，同时对MMLU NLP基准影响极小。

Conclusion: GEM方法为LLM提供了先进的文本嵌入能力，同时保持了其原始NLP性能。

Abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
generation and reasoning tasks, where they generate text responses given
instructions. However, many applications, e.g., retrieval augmented generation
(RAG), still rely on separate embedding models to generate text embeddings,
which can complicate the system and introduce discrepancies in understanding of
the query between the embedding model and LLMs. To address this limitation, we
propose a simple self-supervised approach, Generative Embedding large language
Model (GEM), that enables any large decoder-only LLM to generate high-quality
text embeddings while maintaining its original text generation and reasoning
capabilities. Our method inserts new special token(s) into a text body, and
generates summarization embedding of the text by manipulating the attention
mask. This method could be easily integrated into post-training or fine tuning
stages of any existing LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
by applying it to two popular LLM families, ranging from 1B to 8B parameters,
and evaluating the transformed models on both text embedding benchmarks (MTEB)
and NLP benchmarks (MMLU). The results show that our proposed method
significantly improves the original LLMs on MTEB while having a minimal impact
on MMLU. Our strong results indicate that our approach can empower LLMs with
state-of-the-art text embedding capabilities while maintaining their original
NLP performance

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了训练数据中说话者数量、每位说话者的音频时长和口音多样性对低资源环境下ASR系统对未见口音鲁棒性的影响，发现增加说话者数量比增加每位说话者的时长更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个能服务全球用户的ASR系统，需使其对包括未见口音在内的多种口音具有鲁棒性。

Method: 系统研究了训练数据中说话者数量、音频时长和口音多样性对ASR鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 增加说话者数量比增加每位说话者的时长更有效；口音多样性在说话者数量固定时效果有限。

Conclusion: 建议在ASR训练数据中优先增加说话者数量。

Abstract: To build an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that can serve everyone
in the world, the ASR needs to be robust to a wide range of accents including
unseen accents. We systematically study how three different variables in
training data -- the number of speakers, the audio duration per each individual
speaker, and the diversity of accents -- affect ASR robustness towards unseen
accents in a low-resource training regime. We observe that for a fixed number
of ASR training hours, it is more beneficial to increase the number of speakers
(which means each speaker contributes less) than the number of hours
contributed per speaker. We also observe that more speakers enables ASR
performance gains from scaling number of hours. Surprisingly, we observe
minimal benefits to prioritizing speakers with different accents when the
number of speakers is controlled. Our work suggests that practitioners should
prioritize increasing the speaker count in ASR training data composition for
new languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 句子嵌入在现代NLP和AI系统中至关重要，但其内部结构不透明，难以解释。

Method: 使用字典学习对词级表示进行分解，分析池化操作如何压缩特征为句子表示。

Result: 发现句子嵌入中许多语义和句法特征是线性编码的。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了句子嵌入的透明性和可控性，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is
known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings
using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not
human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it
is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that
combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new
method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable
components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We
analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations,
and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This
bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis,
making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies,
we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence
embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are
linearly encoded in the embeddings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和路径引导层次结构的HTC模型（HTC-CLIP），通过联合学习两种概率分布提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTC模型分别处理标签层次结构和文本编码，但两者互补，结合可提升性能。

Method: 使用对比学习联合学习层次感知的文本表示和路径引导的层次表示，训练中学习两种概率分布，推理时结合使用。

Result: 在两个公开基准数据集上，HTC-CLIP的Macro F1分数比现有最优模型提高了0.99-2.37%。

Conclusion: HTC-CLIP有效结合了两种互补方法，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) has recently gained traction given the
ability to handle complex label hierarchy. This has found applications in
domains like E- commerce, customer care and medicine industry among other
real-world applications. Existing HTC models either encode label hierarchy
separately and mix it with text encoding or guide the label hierarchy structure
in the text encoder. Both approaches capture different characteristics of label
hierarchy and are complementary to each other. In this paper, we propose a
Hierarchical Text Classification using Contrastive Learning Informed Path
guided hierarchy (HTC-CLIP), which learns hierarchy-aware text representation
and text informed path guided hierarchy representation using contrastive
learning. During the training of HTC-CLIP, we learn two different sets of class
probabilities distributions and during inference, we use the pooled output of
both probabilities for each class to get the best of both representations. Our
results show that the two previous approaches can be effectively combined into
one architecture to achieve improved performance. Tests on two public benchmark
datasets showed an improvement of 0.99 - 2.37% in Macro F1 score using HTC-CLIP
over the existing state-of-the-art models.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLM在低资源语言（如马耳他语）上的表现，揭示其局限性，并探索提升性能的方法。

Method: 研究使用了一个新引入的基准测试，涵盖11个判别性和生成性任务，对55个LLM进行了多维分析。

Result: 结果显示，许多LLM表现不佳，尤其是生成任务；小型微调模型表现更好；预训练和指令调整中对马耳他语的接触是关键因素。

Conclusion: 结论指出，微调虽然初始成本高，但性能更好且推理成本更低；建议低资源语言研究考虑更传统的语言建模方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, largely due to their
generalisability and ability to perform tasks without additional training.
However, their effectiveness for low-resource languages remains limited. In
this study, we evaluate the performance of 55 publicly available LLMs on
Maltese, a low-resource language, using a newly introduced benchmark covering
11 discriminative and generative tasks. Our experiments highlight that many
models perform poorly, particularly on generative tasks, and that smaller
fine-tuned models often perform better across all tasks. From our
multidimensional analysis, we investigate various factors impacting
performance. We conclude that prior exposure to Maltese during pre-training and
instruction-tuning emerges as the most important factor. We also examine the
trade-offs between fine-tuning and prompting, highlighting that while
fine-tuning requires a higher initial cost, it yields better performance and
lower inference costs. Through this work, we aim to highlight the need for more
inclusive language technologies and recommend that researchers working with
low-resource languages consider more "traditional" language modelling
approaches.

Result: 在加拿大和墨西哥电商客服数据集上，少样本意图检测准确率比现有SOTA模型提高20-23%。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了跨领域意图分类的少样本性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Customer care is an essential pillar of the e-commerce shopping experience
with companies spending millions of dollars each year, employing automation and
human agents, across geographies (like US, Canada, Mexico, Chile), channels
(like Chat, Interactive Voice Response (IVR)), and languages (like English,
Spanish). SOTA pre-trained models like multilingual-BERT, fine-tuned on
annotated data have shown good performance in downstream tasks relevant to
Customer Care. However, model performance is largely subject to the
availability of sufficient annotated domain-specific data. Cross-domain
availability of data remains a bottleneck, thus building an intent classifier
that generalizes across domains (defined by channel, geography, and language)
with only a few annotations, is of great practical value. In this paper, we
propose an embedder-cum-classifier model architecture which extends
state-of-the-art domain-specific models to other domains with only a few
labeled samples. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning approach with isotropic
regularizers to train a domain-specific sentence embedder and a multilingual
knowledge distillation strategy to generalize this embedder across multiple
domains. The trained embedder, further augmented with a simple linear
classifier can be deployed for new domains. Experiments on Canada and Mexico
e-commerce Customer Care dataset with few-shot intent detection show an
increase in accuracy by 20-23% against the existing state-of-the-art
pre-trained models.

Result: 模型对形式敏感，但对意义的泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 当前架构在语言形式和意义的样本效率上存在不对称性，与人类学习者不同。

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical
phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence
suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a
similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However,
it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and
to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as
opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale
transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of
the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we
construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic
properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to
form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However,
human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning.
These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample
efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in
human language learners.

TL;DR: ZOES是一种无需预定义模式或标注数据的零样本开放模式实体结构发现方法，通过丰富、细化和统一机制提升LLM的实体结构提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的方法依赖预定义实体属性模式或标注数据，导致提取结果不完整，ZOES旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ZOES采用丰富、细化和统一的机制，利用实体与其结构的相互增强关系进行提取。

Result: 实验表明，ZOES在三个不同领域中显著提升了LLM提取实体结构的完整性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ZOES的机制为提升LLM在实体结构发现中的质量提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Entity structure extraction, which aims to extract entities and their
associated attribute-value structures from text, is an essential task for text
understanding and knowledge graph construction. Existing methods based on large
language models (LLMs) typically rely heavily on predefined entity attribute
schemas or annotated datasets, often leading to incomplete extraction results.
To address these challenges, we introduce Zero-Shot Open-schema Entity
Structure Discovery (ZOES), a novel approach to entity structure extraction
that does not require any schema or annotated samples. ZOES operates via a
principled mechanism of enrichment, refinement, and unification, based on the
insight that an entity and its associated structure are mutually reinforcing.
Experiments demonstrate that ZOES consistently enhances LLMs' ability to
extract more complete entity structures across three different domains,
showcasing both the effectiveness and generalizability of the method. These
findings suggest that such an enrichment, refinement, and unification mechanism
may serve as a principled approach to improving the quality of LLM-based entity
structure discovery in various scenarios.

*Apurv Verma,NhatHai Phan,Shubhendu Trivedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了两种流行的水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对大型语言模型（LLMs）在真实性、安全性和有用性上的影响，并提出了一种名为Alignment Resampling（AR）的推理时采样方法以恢复模型的对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水印技术对LLMs输出质量的影响尚未充分研究，尤其是对模型的对齐性（真实性、安全性和有用性）的影响。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过实验分析两种水印方法（Gumbel和KGW）对四种对齐LLMs的影响，并提出AR方法，利用外部奖励模型在推理时恢复对齐性。

Result: 实验发现水印会导致两种退化模式（保护衰减和保护放大），而AR方法仅需2-4次采样即可恢复或超越基线对齐分数。

Conclusion: AR方法有效平衡了水印强度与模型对齐性，为实际部署水印LLMs提供了简单解决方案。

Abstract: Watermarking techniques for large language models (LLMs) can significantly
impact output quality, yet their effects on truthfulness, safety, and
helpfulness remain critically underexamined. This paper presents a systematic
analysis of how two popular watermarking approaches-Gumbel and KGW-affect these
core alignment properties across four aligned LLMs. Our experiments reveal two
distinct degradation patterns: guard attenuation, where enhanced helpfulness
undermines model safety, and guard amplification, where excessive caution
reduces model helpfulness. These patterns emerge from watermark-induced shifts
in token distribution, surfacing the fundamental tension that exists between
alignment objectives.
  To mitigate these degradations, we propose Alignment Resampling (AR), an
inference-time sampling method that uses an external reward model to restore
alignment. We establish a theoretical lower bound on the improvement in
expected reward score as the sample size is increased and empirically
demonstrate that sampling just 2-4 watermarked generations effectively recovers
or surpasses baseline (unwatermarked) alignment scores. To overcome the limited
response diversity of standard Gumbel watermarking, our modified implementation
sacrifices strict distortion-freeness while maintaining robust detectability,
ensuring compatibility with AR. Experimental results confirm that AR
successfully recovers baseline alignment in both watermarking approaches, while
maintaining strong watermark detectability. This work reveals the critical
balance between watermark strength and model alignment, providing a simple
inference-time solution to responsibly deploy watermarked LLMs in practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PUGC框架利用未标记的用户生成内容（UGC）中的隐含偏好生成偏好数据，避免了传统方法依赖昂贵人工标注的局限性，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习方法依赖人工或高级LLMs标注的数据，成本高且难以扩展。UGC虽非显式标注，但隐含了人类偏好，可用于改进LLMs。

Method: PUGC将UGC转化为用户查询，生成模型响应，并利用UGC作为参考文本进行评分，从而对齐隐含偏好。

Result: 实验显示，PUGC结合DPO训练使模型性能提升9.37%，在Mistral-7B-Instruct上达到35.93%的领先胜率，且在奖励质量、领域对齐等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PUGC提供了一种低成本、可扩展的偏好数据生成方法，显著提升了LLMs的对齐效果和生成质量。

Abstract: Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language
models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated
responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on
curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to
scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit
human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate
preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in
generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and
implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address
readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates
responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text
for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This
approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable,
domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that
models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over
traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win
rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward
quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC
quality, and theory of mind capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at

*Yue Gong,Chuan Lei,Xiao Qin,Kapil Vaidya,Balakrishnan Narayanaswamy,Tim Kraska*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SQLens是一个端到端框架，用于细粒度检测和纠正LLM生成的SQL中的语义错误，显著提升了错误检测和执行准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在文本到SQL任务中表现良好，但其生成的查询可能存在语义错误，且缺乏可靠性评估。

Method: SQLens结合数据库和LLM的错误信号，识别SQL子句中的潜在语义错误，并指导查询纠正。

Result: 在两个公共基准测试中，SQLens在错误检测F1上优于最佳LLM自评估方法25.78%，并将现成文本到SQL系统的执行准确性提升至多20%。

Conclusion: SQLens通过集成多源错误信号，显著提升了LLM生成SQL的语义准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language (NL) questions into SQL
queries, enabling non-technical users to interact with structured data. While
large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on the text-to-SQL
task, they often produce semantically incorrect yet syntactically valid
queries, with limited insight into their reliability. We propose SQLens, an
end-to-end framework for fine-grained detection and correction of semantic
errors in LLM-generated SQL. SQLens integrates error signals from both the
underlying database and the LLM to identify potential semantic errors within
SQL clauses. It further leverages these signals to guide query correction.
Empirical results on two public benchmarks show that SQLens outperforms the
best LLM-based self-evaluation method by 25.78% in F1 for error detection, and
improves execution accuracy of out-of-the-box text-to-SQL systems by up to 20%.

TL;DR: 论文提出SLIDE和DRE方法，结合小模型（SLM）和大模型（LLM）的优势，通过自适应加权和双阶段优化，提升对话评估的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型（LLM）在模糊场景中表现不稳定，而小模型（SLM）对误导性输入敏感。两者在正负例处理上各有优势，结合可互补。

Method: 提出SLIDE方法（自适应加权结合SLM和LLM），并进一步提出DRE方法（双阶段优化：SLM引导LLM生成初步评估，SLM调整LLM分数）。

Result: 实验表明DRE优于现有方法，在多基准测试中更符合人类判断。

Conclusion: 结合小模型和大模型能提升开放任务（如对话评估）的可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but struggle with ambiguous
scenarios where multiple valid responses exist, often yielding unreliable
results. Conversely, Small Language Models (SLMs) demonstrate robustness in
such scenarios but are susceptible to misleading or adversarial inputs. We
observed that LLMs handle negative examples effectively, while SLMs excel with
positive examples. To leverage their complementary strengths, we introduce
SLIDE (Small and Large Integrated for Dialogue Evaluation), a method
integrating SLMs and LLMs via adaptive weighting. Building on SLIDE, we further
propose a Dual-Refinement Evaluation (DRE) method to enhance SLM-LLM
integration: (1) SLM-generated insights guide the LLM to produce initial
evaluations; (2) SLM-derived adjustments refine the LLM's scores for improved
accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that DRE outperforms existing methods,
showing stronger alignment with human judgment across diverse benchmarks. This
work illustrates how combining small and large models can yield more reliable
evaluation tools, particularly for open-ended tasks such as dialogue
evaluation.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在翻译任务中，逐步分解的提示策略（如CoT）并未显著提升性能，而简单的“重新翻译”提示反而效果更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨逐步分解翻译任务（如CoT）是否真正提升大型语言模型（LLM）的翻译性能。

Method: 通过实验比较逐步分解提示与简单“重新翻译”提示的效果。

Result: 逐步分解提示未显著提升性能，而“重新翻译”提示效果更优。

Conclusion: 逐步分解翻译任务可能并非性能提升的关键因素，未来需进一步探索CoT在翻译中的有效性因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities for
many tasks, often by explicitly decomposing the task via Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. Recent work on LLM-based translation designs hand-crafted prompts to
decompose translation, or trains models to incorporate intermediate
steps.~\textit{Translating Step-by-step}~\citep{briakou2024translating}, for
instance, introduces a multi-step prompt with decomposition and refinement of
translation with LLMs, which achieved state-of-the-art results on WMT24. In
this work, we scrutinise this strategy's effectiveness. Empirically, we find no
clear evidence that performance gains stem from explicitly decomposing the
translation process, at least for the models on test; and we show that simply
prompting LLMs to ``translate again'' yields even better results than
human-like step-by-step prompting. Our analysis does not rule out the role of
reasoning, but instead invites future work exploring the factors for CoT's
effectiveness in the context of translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能理解话语粒子（如“just”）的复杂语义，填补其在语义理解上的空白。

Method: 使用专家标注的数据集，分析LLMs对“just”不同语义类别的区分能力。

Result: LLMs能区分“just”的宽泛语义类别，但对更细微的语义差别表现不佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在理解话语粒子的细微语义上存在不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Discourse particles are crucial elements that subtly shape the meaning of
text. These words, often polyfunctional, give rise to nuanced and often quite
disparate semantic/discourse effects, as exemplified by the diverse uses of the
particle "just" (e.g., exclusive, temporal, emphatic). This work investigates
the capacity of LLMs to distinguish the fine-grained senses of English "just",
a well-studied example in formal semantics, using data meticulously created and
labeled by expert linguists. Our findings reveal that while LLMs exhibit some
ability to differentiate between broader categories, they struggle to fully
capture more subtle nuances, highlighting a gap in their understanding of
discourse particles.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了SSA-MTE数据集和SSA-COMET评估指标，用于提升非洲低资源语言的机器翻译质量评估，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器翻译质量评估指标在非洲低资源语言中表现不佳，缺乏公开数据集和针对性训练数据。

Method: 构建了包含13种非洲语言对的大规模人工标注数据集SSA-MTE，并基于此开发了SSA-COMET和SSA-COMET-QE评估指标。

Result: SSA-COMET显著优于AfriCOMET，并在低资源语言（如Twi、Luo、Yoruba）中表现优异。

Conclusion: SSA-MTE和SSA-COMET为非洲低资源语言的机器翻译评估提供了有效工具，所有资源已开源。

Abstract: Evaluating machine translation (MT) quality for under-resourced African
languages remains a significant challenge, as existing metrics often suffer
from limited language coverage and poor performance in low-resource settings.
While recent efforts, such as AfriCOMET, have addressed some of the issues,
they are still constrained by small evaluation sets, a lack of publicly
available training data tailored to African languages, and inconsistent
performance in extremely low-resource scenarios. In this work, we introduce
SSA-MTE, a large-scale human-annotated MT evaluation (MTE) dataset covering 13
African language pairs from the News domain, with over 63,000 sentence-level
annotations from a diverse set of MT systems. Based on this data, we develop
SSA-COMET and SSA-COMET-QE, improved reference-based and reference-free
evaluation metrics. We also benchmark prompting-based approaches using
state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4o and Claude. Our experimental results show
that SSA-COMET models significantly outperform AfriCOMET and are competitive
with the strongest LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) evaluated in our study, particularly on
low-resource languages such as Twi, Luo, and Yoruba. All resources are released
under open licenses to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统（MAS）在分布式合作中潜力巨大，但可能被恶意代理利用，通过提示操纵破坏系统完整性。本文旨在揭示这种攻击的潜在威胁。

Method: 研究了四种攻击类型（Scapegoater、Boaster、Self-Dealer、Free-Rider），并通过精心设计的提示展示了如何系统性偏置MAS行为。

Result: 实验证明，这些攻击能绕过先进的LLM监控系统（如GPT-4o-mini和o3-mini），成功误导评估和协作代理。

Conclusion: 当前MAS架构需加强安全协议和内容验证机制，监控系统需具备全面风险评估能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
natural language understanding, code generation, and complex planning.
Simultaneously, Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have garnered attention for their
potential to enable cooperation among distributed agents. However, from a
multi-party perspective, MAS could be vulnerable to malicious agents that
exploit the system to serve self-interests without disrupting its core
functionality. This work explores integrity attacks where malicious agents
employ subtle prompt manipulation to bias MAS operations and gain various
benefits. Four types of attacks are examined: \textit{Scapegoater}, who
misleads the system monitor to underestimate other agents' contributions;
\textit{Boaster}, who misleads the system monitor to overestimate their own
performance; \textit{Self-Dealer}, who manipulates other agents to adopt
certain tools; and \textit{Free-Rider}, who hands off its own task to others.
We demonstrate that strategically crafted prompts can introduce systematic
biases in MAS behavior and executable instructions, enabling malicious agents
to effectively mislead evaluation systems and manipulate collaborative agents.
Furthermore, our attacks can bypass advanced LLM-based monitors, such as
GPT-4o-mini and o3-mini, highlighting the limitations of current detection
mechanisms. Our findings underscore the critical need for MAS architectures
with robust security protocols and content validation mechanisms, alongside
monitoring systems capable of comprehensive risk scenario assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在零样本金融情感分析中的有效性，尤其是推理与非推理模型的对比。

Method: 使用Financial PhraseBank数据集，比较不同LLMs和提示策略（模拟System 1或System 2思维），并对比微调的小型模型。

Result: GPT-4o无需Chain-of-Thought提示表现最佳，推理可能导致过度思考，降低预测准确性。

Conclusion: 金融情感分类中，直觉式思考优于推理式思考，挑战了‘更多推理总是更好’的默认假设。

Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), including
reasoning-based and non-reasoning models, in performing zero-shot financial
sentiment analysis. Using the Financial PhraseBank dataset annotated by domain
experts, we evaluate how various LLMs and prompting strategies align with
human-labeled sentiment in a financial context. We compare three proprietary
LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3-mini) under different prompting paradigms that
simulate System 1 (fast and intuitive) or System 2 (slow and deliberate)
thinking and benchmark them against two smaller models (FinBERT-Prosus,
FinBERT-Tone) fine-tuned on financial sentiment analysis. Our findings suggest
that reasoning, either through prompting or inherent model design, does not
improve performance on this task. Surprisingly, the most accurate and
human-aligned combination of model and method was GPT-4o without any
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. We further explore how performance is
impacted by linguistic complexity and annotation agreement levels, uncovering
that reasoning may introduce overthinking, leading to suboptimal predictions.
This suggests that for financial sentiment classification, fast, intuitive
"System 1"-like thinking aligns more closely with human judgment compared to
"System 2"-style slower, deliberative reasoning simulated by reasoning models
or CoT prompting. Our results challenge the default assumption that more
reasoning always leads to better LLM decisions, particularly in high-stakes
financial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在逻辑翻译中难以处理词汇多样性，且现有基准缺乏词汇多样性，掩盖了这一问题。

Method: 提出SCALe基准，通过逻辑不变的词汇多样化生成新数据集；提出MenTaL方法，指导LLMs构建统一表达表后再翻译。

Result: 实验证实当前LLMs在词汇多样化翻译中存在不足，MenTaL方法显著提升了翻译性能。

Conclusion: SCALe和MenTaL为LLMs在逻辑翻译中的词汇多样性问题提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic approaches combining large language models (LLMs) with solvers
excels in logical reasoning problems need long reasoning chains. In this
paradigm, LLMs serve as translators, converting natural language reasoning
problems into formal logic formulas. Then reliable symbolic solvers return
correct solutions. Despite their success, we find that LLMs, as translators,
struggle to handle lexical diversification, a common linguistic phenomenon,
indicating that LLMs as logic translators are unreliable in real-world
scenarios. Moreover, existing logical reasoning benchmarks lack lexical
diversity, failing to challenge LLMs' ability to translate such text and thus
obscuring this issue. In this work, we propose SCALe, a benchmark designed to
address this significant gap through **logic-invariant lexical
diversification**. By using LLMs to transform original benchmark datasets into
lexically diversified but logically equivalent versions, we evaluate LLMs'
ability to consistently map diverse expressions to uniform logical symbols on
these new datasets. Experiments using SCALe further confirm that current LLMs
exhibit deficiencies in this capability. Building directly on the deficiencies
identified through our benchmark, we propose a new method, MenTaL, to address
this limitation. This method guides LLMs to first construct a table unifying
diverse expressions before performing translation. Applying MenTaL through
in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) significantly improves the
performance of LLM translators on lexically diversified text. Our code is now
available at https://github.com/wufeiwuwoshihua/LexicalDiver.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法在多示例场景中依赖随机选择演示，而传统实例级检索方法不适用，因此需要一种更有效的选择方法。

Method: 通过梯度匹配方法，将目标任务的整个训练集的微调梯度与所选示例对齐，以在所选示例中接近整个训练集的学习效果。

Result: 在4-shot到128-shot场景中，该方法在9个数据集上显著优于随机选择，例如在Qwen2.5-72B和Llama3-70B上提升4%，在5个闭源LLMs上提升约2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为多示例ICL提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案，推动了其更广泛的应用。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) for rapid
task adaptation without Fine-Tuning (FT), but its reliance on demonstration
selection remains a critical challenge. While many-shot ICL shows promising
performance through scaled demonstrations, the selection method for many-shot
demonstrations remains limited to random selection in existing work. Since the
conventional instance-level retrieval is not suitable for many-shot scenarios,
we hypothesize that the data requirements for in-context learning and
fine-tuning are analogous. To this end, we introduce a novel gradient matching
approach that selects demonstrations by aligning fine-tuning gradients between
the entire training set of the target task and the selected examples, so as to
approach the learning effect on the entire training set within the selected
examples. Through gradient matching on relatively small models, e.g.,
Qwen2.5-3B or Llama3-8B, our method consistently outperforms random selection
on larger LLMs from 4-shot to 128-shot scenarios across 9 diverse datasets. For
instance, it surpasses random selection by 4% on Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3-70B,
and by around 2% on 5 closed-source LLMs. This work unlocks more reliable and
effective many-shot ICL, paving the way for its broader application.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性声明设计用于挑战事实核查系统，现有基于检索增强语言模型的系统难以应对。

Method: SUCEA框架分三步：1)声明分割与去上下文化；2)迭代证据检索与声明编辑；3)证据聚合与标签预测。

Result: 在两个数据集上显著提升了检索和标签预测准确性，优于四种基线方法。

Conclusion: SUCEA框架有效应对对抗性声明，提升事实核查性能。

Abstract: Automatic fact-checking has recently received more attention as a means of
combating misinformation. Despite significant advancements, fact-checking
systems based on retrieval-augmented language models still struggle to tackle
adversarial claims, which are intentionally designed by humans to challenge
fact-checking systems. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free
method designed to rephrase the original claim, making it easier to locate
supporting evidence. Our modular framework, SUCEA, decomposes the task into
three steps: 1) Claim Segmentation and Decontextualization that segments
adversarial claims into independent sub-claims; 2) Iterative Evidence Retrieval
and Claim Editing that iteratively retrieves evidence and edits the subclaim
based on the retrieved evidence; 3) Evidence Aggregation and Label Prediction
that aggregates all retrieved evidence and predicts the entailment label.
Experiments on two challenging fact-checking datasets demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves on both retrieval and entailment label
accuracy, outperforming four strong claim-decomposition-based baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学QA、图表标题生成等多模态推理任务缺乏直接测试声明验证能力的基准，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过自动提取科学文章中的支持声明，并手动扰动生成矛盾声明，设计诊断任务以评估模型能力。

Result: 大多数视觉语言模型表现不佳（F1分数0.3-0.5），最佳模型仅达0.77 F1，且存在偏向支持声明的偏差。

Conclusion: 模型在定位证据、跨模态信息聚合及理解图表基础组件方面存在显著缺陷，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Assessing scientific claims requires identifying, extracting, and reasoning
with multimodal data expressed in information-rich figures in scientific
literature. Despite the large body of work in scientific QA, figure captioning,
and other multimodal reasoning tasks over chart-based data, there are no
readily usable multimodal benchmarks that directly test claim verification
abilities. To remedy this gap, we introduce a new benchmark MuSciClaims
accompanied by diagnostics tasks. We automatically extract supported claims
from scientific articles, which we manually perturb to produce contradicted
claims. The perturbations are designed to test for a specific set of claim
verification capabilities. We also introduce a suite of diagnostic tasks that
help understand model failures. Our results show most vision-language models
are poor (~0.3-0.5 F1), with even the best model only achieving 0.77 F1. They
are also biased towards judging claims as supported, likely misunderstanding
nuanced perturbations within the claims. Our diagnostics show models are bad at
localizing correct evidence within figures, struggle with aggregating
information across modalities, and often fail to understand basic components of
the figure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督学习中伪标签质量不高的问题，利用LLM的知识提升模型性能。

Method: 通过LLM校正ASR/AST生成的伪标签，并结合数据过滤策略优化知识转移效率。

Result: 在普通话ASR和西班牙语-英语AST任务中，WER显著降低3.77%，BLEU得分分别达到34.0和64.7。

Conclusion: LESS框架在多语言、多任务和多领域中表现出强大的适应性和有效性。

Abstract: We introduce LESS (Large Language Model Enhanced Semi-supervised Learning), a
versatile framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to correct
pseudo labels generated from in-the-wild data. Within the LESS framework,
pseudo-labeled text from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) or Automatic Speech
Translation (AST) of the unsupervised data is refined by an LLM, and augmented
by a data filtering strategy to optimize LLM knowledge transfer efficiency.
Experiments on both Mandarin ASR and Spanish-to-English AST tasks show that
LESS achieves a notable absolute WER reduction of 3.77% on the Wenet Speech
test set, as well as BLEU scores of 34.0 and 64.7 on Callhome and Fisher test
sets respectively. These results validate the adaptability of LESS across
different languages, tasks, and domains. Ablation studies conducted with
various LLMs and prompt configurations provide novel insights into leveraging
LLM-derived knowledge for speech processing applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为$Safe$的回顾性、步骤感知的形式验证框架，利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证大语言模型（LLMs）生成的推理步骤，以减少幻觉并提供可验证证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示方法存在难以检测的幻觉问题，现有方法（如过程奖励模型或自一致性）缺乏可验证证据。受数学证明启发，作者希望通过形式化语言提供可验证的支持。

Method: 提出$Safe$框架，使用Lean 4形式化数学语言在每个推理步骤中表达数学声明并提供形式化证明。还提出$FormalStep$作为步骤正确性定理证明的基准。

Result: 在多个语言模型和数学数据集上验证$Safe$，显示性能显著提升，并提供可解释和可验证的证据。

Conclusion: $Safe$是首个利用Lean 4形式化数学语言验证LLMs生成内容的框架，为幻觉问题提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit
reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate
hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods
such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque
boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly
limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from
the idea that "the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to
provide a proof". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification
framework $Safe$. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to
articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each
reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We
evaluate our framework $Safe$ across multiple language models and various
mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement
while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose
$FormalStep$ as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with $30,809$
formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first
endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying natural
language content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal
mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust
foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs.

*Firoz Shaik,Mobashir Sadat,Nikita Gautam,Doina Caragea,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MISMATCHED，一个用于科学自然语言推理（NLI）的新评估基准，覆盖心理学、工程学和公共卫生三个非计算机科学领域，包含2700个人工标注的句子对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有科学NLI数据集仅关注计算机科学领域，忽视了其他学科领域，因此需要扩展数据集以促进跨领域研究。

Method: 构建MISMATCHED基准，包含非计算机科学领域的句子对，并使用预训练的小型和大型语言模型建立基线。

Result: 最佳基线模型的Macro F1为78.17%，显示未来改进空间大。同时，训练中加入隐含科学NLI关系的句子对可提升模型性能。

Conclusion: MISMATCHED填补了非计算机科学领域科学NLI数据集的空白，并展示了改进模型性能的潜在方法。

Abstract: Scientific Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of predicting the
semantic relation between a pair of sentences extracted from research articles.
Existing datasets for this task are derived from various computer science (CS)
domains, whereas non-CS domains are completely ignored. In this paper, we
introduce a novel evaluation benchmark for scientific NLI, called MISMATCHED.
The new MISMATCHED benchmark covers three non-CS domains-PSYCHOLOGY,
ENGINEERING, and PUBLIC HEALTH, and contains 2,700 human annotated sentence
pairs. We establish strong baselines on MISMATCHED using both Pre-trained Small
Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our best performing
baseline shows a Macro F1 of only 78.17% illustrating the substantial headroom
for future improvements. In addition to introducing the MISMATCHED benchmark,
we show that incorporating sentence pairs having an implicit scientific NLI
relation between them in model training improves their performance on
scientific NLI. We make our dataset and code publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: TTS通过推理时分配额外计算提升LLM性能，ADAPT方法通过多样性优化显著减少计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理优化模型输出多样性不足，限制了TTS效果。

Method: 提出ADAPT方法，结合前缀调优和多样性数据策略。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，ADAPT以8倍少计算达到80%准确率。

Conclusion: 生成多样性对最大化TTS效果至关重要。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the reasoning performance of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by allocating additional compute during inference. We conduct a
structured survey of TTS methods and categorize them into sampling-based,
search-based, and trajectory optimization strategies. We observe that
reasoning-optimized models often produce less diverse outputs, which limits TTS
effectiveness. To address this, we propose ADAPT (A Diversity Aware Prefix
fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that applies prefix tuning with a
diversity-focused data strategy. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks
show that ADAPT reaches 80% accuracy using eight times less compute than strong
baselines. Our findings highlight the essential role of generative diversity in
maximizing TTS effectiveness.

TL;DR: 论文通过机器学习方法量化创新者的主观视角和背景多样性，发现视角多样性促进创新，而背景多样性可能阻碍创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究关注社会结构对创新能力的影响，但缺乏对创新者个人视角和人际互动机会的量化分析。

Method: 利用动态语言表示建模创新者的主观视角和背景多样性，分析科学家、发明家等群体的数据，并进行自然实验和AI模拟。

Result: 视角多样性显著预测创新成就，而背景多样性则相反。成功的合作者通过共同语言整合多样经验。

Conclusion: 研究为团队组建和研究政策提供了新视角，强调视角多样性的重要性。

Abstract: Existing studies of innovation emphasize the power of social structures to
shape innovation capacity. Emerging machine learning approaches, however,
enable us to model innovators' personal perspectives and interpersonal
innovation opportunities as a function of their prior trajectories of
experience. We theorize then quantify subjective perspectives and innovation
opportunities based on innovator positions within the geometric space of
concepts inscribed by dynamic language representations. Using data on millions
of scientists, inventors, writers, entrepreneurs, and Wikipedia contributors
across the creative domains of science, technology, film, entrepreneurship, and
Wikipedia, here we show that measured subjective perspectives anticipate what
ideas individuals and groups creatively attend to and successfully combine in
future. When perspective and background diversity are decomposed as the angular
difference between collaborators' perspectives on their creation and between
their experiences, the former consistently anticipates creative achievement
while the latter portends its opposite, across all cases and time periods
examined. We analyze a natural experiment and simulate creative collaborations
between AI (large language model) agents designed with various perspective and
background diversity, which are consistent with our observational findings. We
explore mechanisms underlying these findings and identify how successful
collaborators leverage common language to weave together diverse experience
obtained through trajectories of prior work that converge to provoke one
another and innovate. We explore the importance of these findings for team
assembly and research policy.

*Takashi Wada,Yuki Hirakawa,Ryotaro Shimizu,Takahiro Kawashima,Yuki Saito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化的静态词嵌入方法，通过句子级主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习改进预训练的词嵌入，以低成本实现句子语义表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进静态词嵌入在句子语义表示中的性能，使其接近动态模型的效果。

Method: 从预训练的Sentence Transformer提取词嵌入，通过句子级主成分分析和知识蒸馏或对比学习优化。推理时通过简单平均词嵌入表示句子。

Result: 在单语和跨语言任务中显著优于现有静态模型，部分数据集上甚至接近SimCSE。

Conclusion: 方法成功去除了与句子语义无关的词嵌入成分，并根据词对句子语义的影响调整向量范数。

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic
representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence
Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis,
followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During
inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which
requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and
cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing
static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even rivals a basic Sentence
Transformer model (SimCSE) on some data sets. Lastly, we perform a variety of
analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding
components that are irrelevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector
norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

TL;DR: Tool-MVR通过多代理元验证和探索性反思学习，解决了大语言模型在工具规划和反思能力上的不足，显著提升了性能并减少了API调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在工具规划和反思能力上存在显著不足，导致API调用不可靠且错误修正能力弱。

Method: 提出Tool-MVR，结合多代理元验证（MAMV）构建高质量指令数据集ToolBench-V，并通过探索性反思学习（EXPLORE）生成反思数据集ToolBench-R。

Result: Tool-MVR在StableToolBench上性能超越ToolLLM和GPT-4，API调用减少31.4%；在RefineToolBench上错误修正率显著提高。

Conclusion: Tool-MVR通过系统性验证和动态学习范式，显著提升了大语言模型的工具利用能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Empowering large language models (LLMs) with effective tool utilization
capabilities is crucial for enabling AI agents to solve complex problems.
However, current models face two major limitations: (1) unreliable tool
planning and invocation due to low-quality instruction datasets (e.g.,
widespread hallucinated API calls), and (2) weak tool reflection abilities
(over 90% of errors cannot be corrected) resulting from static imitation
learning. To address these critical limitations, we propose Tool-MVR, a novel
Tool-Augmented LLM that achieves comprehensive System 2 reasoning through two
key innovations. Specifically, we first introduce Multi-Agent Meta-Verification
(MAMV), a systematic pipeline that rigorously validates APIs, queries, and
reasoning trajectories to construct ToolBench-V, a new high-quality instruction
dataset that addresses the limitation of unreliable tool planning and
invocation. Second, we propose Exploration-based Reflection Learning (EXPLORE),
which enhances tool reflection capabilities by leveraging tool feedback through
a dynamic "Error -> Reflection -> Correction" learning paradigm, resulting in
our reflection dataset ToolBench-R and addressing the critical weakness in tool
reflection. Finally, we obtain Tool-MVR by finetuning open-source LLMs (e.g.,
Qwen-7B) on both ToolBench-V and ToolBench-R. Our experiments demonstrate that
Tool-MVR achieves state-of-the-art performance on StableToolBench, surpassing
both ToolLLM (by 23.9%) and GPT-4 (by 15.3%) while reducing API calls by 31.4%,
with strong generalization capabilities across unseen tools and scenarios.
Additionally, on our proposed RefineToolBench, the first benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate tool reflection capabilities, Tool-MVR achieves a 58.9%
error correction rate, significantly outperforming ToolLLM's 9.1%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，并展示了其在越南语中的有效性，显著提升了在嘈杂环境中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言的AVSR数据集，尤其是英语以外的语言，限制了AVSR模型的发展。自动数据收集为解决这一问题提供了可能。

Method: 提出了一种从原始视频生成AVSR数据集的实用方法，改进了现有技术以提高效率和可访问性。

Result: 实验表明，自动收集的数据集能够建立一个强大的基线模型，在干净环境中表现优异，在嘈杂环境中显著优于传统ASR。

Conclusion: 该方法为扩展AVSR至更多语言（尤其是资源匮乏的语言）提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) has gained significant attention
recently due to its robustness against noise, which often challenges
conventional speech recognition systems that rely solely on audio features.
Despite this advantage, AVSR models remain limited by the scarcity of extensive
datasets, especially for most languages beyond English. Automated data
collection offers a promising solution. This work presents a practical approach
to generate AVSR datasets from raw video, refining existing techniques for
improved efficiency and accessibility. We demonstrate its broad applicability
by developing a baseline AVSR model for Vietnamese. Experiments show the
automatically collected dataset enables a strong baseline, achieving
competitive performance with robust ASR in clean conditions and significantly
outperforming them in noisy environments like cocktail parties. This efficient
method provides a pathway to expand AVSR to more languages, particularly
under-resourced ones.

TL;DR: TaDA是一种无需训练的KV缓存压缩方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化消除异常值处理，显著减少内存占用并保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在Transformer模型中内存需求随序列长度增长而急剧增加，限制了大型语言模型的可扩展部署。

Method: 提出TaDA方法，通过自适应量化精度和均值中心化处理，无需单独管理异常值。

Result: 实验表明，TaDA将KV缓存内存占用降至原始16位基准的27%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: TaDA为语言模型的可扩展高性能推理铺平道路，支持更长上下文和推理任务。

Abstract: The key-value (KV) cache in transformer models is a critical component for
efficient decoding or inference, yet its memory demands scale poorly with
sequence length, posing a major challenge for scalable deployment of large
language models. Among several approaches to KV cache compression, quantization
of key and value activations has been widely explored. Most KV cache
quantization methods still need to manage sparse and noncontiguous outliers
separately. To address this, we introduce TaDA, a training-free recipe for KV
cache compression with quantization precision that adapts to error sensitivity
across layers and a mean centering to eliminate separate outlier handling. Our
approach yields substantial accuracy improvements for multiple models
supporting various context lengths. Moreover, our approach does not need to
separately manage outlier elements -- a persistent hurdle in most traditional
quantization methods. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
technique reduces KV cache memory footprint to 27% of the original 16-bit
baseline while achieving comparable accuracy. Our method paves the way for
scalable and high-performance reasoning in language models by potentially
enabling inference for longer context length models, reasoning models, and
longer chain of thoughts.

TL;DR: Flex-TravelPlanner是一个评估语言模型在动态规划场景中灵活推理能力的基准测试，揭示了当前模型在多轮任务和约束优先级处理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的规划问题需要适应不断变化的需求和平衡竞争约束，而现有基准测试主要关注静态、单轮场景。

Method: 基于TravelPlanner数据集，引入两种新评估设置：多轮顺序约束引入和明确优先级的竞争约束场景。

Result: 分析GPT-4o和Llama 3.1 70B发现，模型在多轮任务中的适应能力较差，约束引入顺序和优先级处理显著影响性能。

Conclusion: 强调了在更现实的动态规划场景中评估LLMs的重要性，并提出了改进模型性能的具体方向。

Abstract: Real-world planning problems require constant adaptation to changing
requirements and balancing of competing constraints. However, current
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities primarily focus on
static, single-turn scenarios. We introduce Flex-TravelPlanner, a benchmark
that evaluates language models' ability to reason flexibly in dynamic planning
scenarios. Building on the TravelPlanner dataset~\citep{xie2024travelplanner},
we introduce two novel evaluation settings: (1) sequential constraint
introduction across multiple turns, and (2) scenarios with explicitly
prioritized competing constraints. Our analysis of GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 70B
reveals several key findings: models' performance on single-turn tasks poorly
predicts their ability to adapt plans across multiple turns; constraint
introduction order significantly affects performance; and models struggle with
constraint prioritization, often incorrectly favoring newly introduced lower
priority preferences over existing higher-priority constraints. These findings
highlight the importance of evaluating LLMs in more realistic, dynamic planning
scenarios and suggest specific directions for improving model performance on
complex planning tasks. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly
available at https://github.com/juhyunohh/FlexTravelBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统（如LLMs）的发展，其安全部署问题日益突出，尤其是价值对齐的不足可能导致潜在危害。

Method: 通过分析现有对齐策略的局限性，结合道德心理学研究，揭示LLMs缺乏深度规范推理能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs易受对抗攻击，且现有方法无法解决其规范冲突的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐方法不足以应对日益强大的AI系统带来的潜在风险，需探索更深层次的规范推理能力。

Abstract: The progress of AI systems such as large language models (LLMs) raises
increasingly pressing concerns about their safe deployment. This paper examines
the value alignment problem for LLMs, arguing that current alignment strategies
are fundamentally inadequate to prevent misuse. Despite ongoing efforts to
instill norms such as helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in LLMs through
fine-tuning based on human preferences, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that exploit conflicts between these norms. I argue that this
vulnerability reflects a fundamental limitation of existing alignment methods:
they reinforce shallow behavioral dispositions rather than endowing LLMs with a
genuine capacity for normative deliberation. Drawing from on research in moral
psychology, I show how humans' ability to engage in deliberative reasoning
enhances their resilience against similar adversarial tactics. LLMs, by
contrast, lack a robust capacity to detect and rationally resolve normative
conflicts, leaving them susceptible to manipulation; even recent advances in
reasoning-focused LLMs have not addressed this vulnerability. This ``shallow
alignment'' problem carries significant implications for AI safety and
regulation, suggesting that current approaches are insufficient for mitigating
potential harms posed by increasingly capable AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练数据不足的问题，尤其是高质量文本的稀缺性，探索如何利用被过滤的低质量数据。

Method: 提出REWIRE方法，通过引导改写（guided rewrite）将低质量文档转化为可用训练数据，并与高质量原始文本混合使用。

Result: 在1B、3B和7B规模的实验中，混合数据比仅使用过滤数据提升了1.0、1.3和2.5个百分点，且优于其他合成数据方法。

Conclusion: 改写低质量网络文本是一种简单有效的预训练数据扩展方法，具有潜力。

Abstract: Scaling laws predict that the performance of large language models improves
with increasing model size and data size. In practice, pre-training has been
relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available
on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the
same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality
texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of
the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the "data wall"
of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data
discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web
with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they
could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the
representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at
1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw
texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points
improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only
filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more
effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we
demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming
lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also
outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including
Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge
extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential
for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.

Motivation: 互联网上的仇恨言论（尤其是隐式仇恨言论）对社会和谐与个人福祉构成威胁，现有方法难以有效检测隐式仇恨言论。

Method: 提出六种编码策略（codetypes），并采用两种方法：1）直接提示大型语言模型（LLMs）分类；2）将codetypes嵌入LLMs的编码过程。

Result: 实验表明，使用codetypes显著提升了中英文数据集中的隐式仇恨言论检测效果。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了隐式仇恨言论检测的挑战，具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: The internet has become a hotspot for hate speech (HS), threatening societal
harmony and individual well-being. While automatic detection methods perform
well in identifying explicit hate speech (ex-HS), they struggle with more
subtle forms, such as implicit hate speech (im-HS). We tackle this problem by
introducing a new taxonomy for im-HS detection, defining six encoding
strategies named codetypes. We present two methods for integrating codetypes
into im-HS detection: 1) prompting large language models (LLMs) directly to
classify sentences based on generated responses, and 2) using LLMs as encoders
with codetypes embedded during the encoding process. Experiments show that the
use of codetypes improves im-HS detection in both Chinese and English datasets,
validating the effectiveness of our approach across different languages.

Result: STAND在多个模型和推理任务中减少推理延迟60-65%，吞吐量优于现有方法14-28%。

Conclusion: STAND是一种无需额外训练的即插即用解决方案，适用于任何现有语言模型。

Abstract: Language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling techniques like best-of-N sampling and tree search.
However, these approaches often demand substantial computational resources,
creating a critical trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce
STAND (STochastic Adaptive N-gram Drafting), a novel model-free speculative
decoding approach that leverages the inherent redundancy in reasoning
trajectories to achieve significant acceleration without compromising accuracy.
Our analysis reveals that reasoning paths frequently reuse similar reasoning
patterns, enabling efficient model-free token prediction without requiring
separate draft models. By introducing stochastic drafting and preserving
probabilistic information through a memory-efficient logit-based N-gram module,
combined with optimized Gumbel-Top-K sampling and data-driven tree
construction, STAND significantly improves token acceptance rates. Extensive
evaluations across multiple models and reasoning tasks (AIME-2024,
GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that STAND reduces inference
latency by 60-65% compared to standard autoregressive decoding while
maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, STAND outperforms state-of-the-art
speculative decoding methods by 14-28% in throughput and shows strong
performance even in single-trajectory scenarios, reducing inference latency by
48-58%. As a model-free approach, STAND can be applied to any existing language
model without additional training, being a powerful plug-and-play solution for
accelerating language model reasoning.

Result: 实验表明，超参数选择和简单有效的数据增强技术显著提升了低资源环境下的翻译性能。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言对中，超参数优化和数据增强是提升语音翻译质量的关键。

Abstract: This paper presents the submission of IIITH-BUT to the IWSLT 2025 shared task
on speech translation for the low-resource Bhojpuri-Hindi language pair. We
explored the impact of hyperparameter optimisation and data augmentation
techniques on the performance of the SeamlessM4T model fine-tuned for this
specific task. We systematically investigated a range of hyperparameters
including learning rate schedules, number of update steps, warm-up steps, label
smoothing, and batch sizes; and report their effect on translation quality. To
address data scarcity, we applied speed perturbation and SpecAugment and
studied their effect on translation quality. We also examined the use of
cross-lingual signal through joint training with Marathi and Bhojpuri speech
data. Our experiments reveal that careful selection of hyperparameters and the
application of simple yet effective augmentation techniques significantly
improve performance in low-resource settings. We also analysed the translation
hypotheses to understand various kinds of errors that impacted the translation
quality in terms of BLEU.

*Yuru Jiang,Wenxuan Ding,Shangbin Feng,Greg Durrett,Yulia Tsvetkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPARTA ALIGNMENT是一种通过竞争和对抗集体对齐多个LLM的算法，利用模型间的竞争和评估提升生成多样性和减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单一模型在生成多样性和评估偏见上的不足，通过多模型竞争和相互评估实现集体优化。

Method: 多个LLM组成“斯巴达部落”，通过指令对抗和相互评估，利用改进的elo排名系统聚合评分，生成偏好对供模型学习。

Result: 在12个任务和数据集中的10个上优于初始模型和4个自对齐基线，平均提升7.0%，且能更好地泛化到未见任务。

Conclusion: SPARTA ALIGNMENT通过集体竞争实现多模型的自我进化，生成更逻辑、直接和丰富的结果。

Abstract: We propose SPARTA ALIGNMENT, an algorithm to collectively align multiple LLMs
through competition and combat. To complement a single model's lack of
diversity in generation and biases in evaluation, multiple LLMs form a "sparta
tribe" to compete against each other in fulfilling instructions while serving
as judges for the competition of others. For each iteration, one instruction
and two models are selected for a duel, the other models evaluate the two
responses, and their evaluation scores are aggregated through a adapted
elo-ranking based reputation system, where winners/losers of combat gain/lose
weight in evaluating others. The peer-evaluated combat results then become
preference pairs where the winning response is preferred over the losing one,
and all models learn from these preferences at the end of each iteration.
SPARTA ALIGNMENT enables the self-evolution of multiple LLMs in an iterative
and collective competition process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SPARTA ALIGNMENT outperforms initial models and 4 self-alignment baselines
across 10 out of 12 tasks and datasets with 7.0% average improvement. Further
analysis reveals that SPARTA ALIGNMENT generalizes more effectively to unseen
tasks and leverages the expertise diversity of participating models to produce
more logical, direct and informative outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为C²EFND的新框架，结合大型和小型语言模型的优势，通过多轮协作学习和知识更新模块，显著提升了假新闻检测的准确性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假新闻在社交媒体上的广泛传播对社会造成严重影响，而现有方法（如小型语言模型和大型语言模型）在适应性和准确性上存在不足。

Method: 提出C²EFND框架，结合大型语言模型的泛化能力和小型语言模型的分类专长，采用多轮协作学习，并引入终身知识编辑模块和基于回放的持续学习方法。

Result: 在Pheme和Twitter16数据集上的实验表明，C²EFND显著优于现有方法，提高了检测准确性和适应性。

Conclusion: C²EFND框架有效解决了假新闻检测中的适应性和准确性挑战，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The widespread dissemination of fake news on social media has significantly
impacted society, resulting in serious consequences. Conventional deep learning
methodologies employing small language models (SLMs) suffer from extensive
supervised training requirements and difficulties adapting to evolving news
environments due to data scarcity and distribution shifts. Large language
models (LLMs), despite robust zero-shot capabilities, fall short in accurately
detecting fake news owing to outdated knowledge and the absence of suitable
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Collaborative
Emergent Fake News Detection (C$^2$EFND) framework to address these challenges.
The C$^2$EFND framework strategically leverages both LLMs' generalization power
and SLMs' classification expertise via a multi-round collaborative learning
framework. We further introduce a lifelong knowledge editing module based on a
Mixture-of-Experts architecture to incrementally update LLMs and a replay-based
continue learning method to ensure SLMs retain prior knowledge without
retraining entirely. Extensive experiments on Pheme and Twitter16 datasets
demonstrate that C$^2$EFND significantly outperforms existed methods,
effectively improving detection accuracy and adaptability in continuous
emergent fake news scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文分析了传统文本修订评估指标的局限性，探索了更符合人类判断的替代方法，包括参考无关指标和LLM评估，最终提出混合方法最可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如ROUGE和BERTScore）主要关注相似性而非改进质量，难以准确评估科学写作中的文本修订。

Method: 通过手动标注研究评估修订质量，探索参考无关指标和LLM评估方法，分析其在不同场景下的表现。

Result: LLM能有效评估指令遵循性但难以判断正确性，领域特定指标提供补充信息，混合方法最可靠。

Conclusion: 结合LLM评估和任务特定指标的混合方法能更可靠地评估修订质量。

Abstract: Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as
traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity
rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and
identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation
methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual
annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we
investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains.
Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to
assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs
effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while
domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid
approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers
the most reliable assessment of revision quality.

TL;DR: 该论文通过多维度政治学习框架和可解释表示工程技术，探究LLMs内部政治意图，解决了单轴概念混淆问题，并验证了向量在检测和干预中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs的开放回答与其内部意图存在偏差，且现有分析多依赖单轴概念易导致混淆，因此需更透明的方法揭示LLMs内部政治状态。

Method: 设计四维政治学习框架，构建对应数据集，应用三种表示工程技术在八个开源LLMs上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明向量能解构政治概念混淆，检测任务验证其语义意义并在OOD设置中表现良好，干预实验可改变LLMs回答的政治倾向。

Conclusion: 多维度框架和表示工程技术能有效揭示和干预LLMs内部政治意图，提升透明度和可控性。

Abstract: Studies of LLMs' political opinions mainly rely on evaluations of their
open-ended responses. Recent work indicates that there is a misalignment
between LLMs' responses and their internal intentions. This motivates us to
probe LLMs' internal mechanisms and help uncover their internal political
states. Additionally, we found that the analysis of LLMs' political opinions
often relies on single-axis concepts, which can lead to concept confounds. In
this work, we extend the single-axis to multi-dimensions and apply
interpretable representation engineering techniques for more transparent LLM
political concept learning. Specifically, we designed a four-dimensional
political learning framework and constructed a corresponding dataset for
fine-grained political concept vector learning. These vectors can be used to
detect and intervene in LLM internals. Experiments are conducted on eight
open-source LLMs with three representation engineering techniques. Results show
these vectors can disentangle political concept confounds. Detection tasks
validate the semantic meaning of the vectors and show good generalization and
robustness in OOD settings. Intervention Experiments show these vectors can
intervene in LLMs to generate responses with different political leanings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMSU是一个专为口语理解和推理设计的综合基准，包含5000个音频-问题-答案三元组，覆盖47种任务，评估了14种先进SpeechLLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SpeechLLMs在细粒度感知和复杂推理方面的能力尚未充分探索，MMSU旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过系统整合语音学、韵律学、修辞学、句法学、语义学和副语言学等语言现象，构建了一个全面的评估基准。

Result: 评估发现现有模型有显著改进空间，为未来优化提供了方向。

Conclusion: MMSU为口语理解设立了新标准，对开发更复杂的人机语音交互系统具有重要价值。

Abstract: Speech inherently contains rich acoustic information that extends far beyond
the textual language. In real-world spoken language understanding, effective
interpretation often requires integrating semantic meaning (e.g., content),
paralinguistic features (e.g., emotions, speed, pitch) and phonological
characteristics (e.g., prosody, intonation, rhythm), which are embedded in
speech. While recent multimodal Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing audio information, their
ability to perform fine-grained perception and complex reasoning in natural
speech remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce MMSU, a
comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for understanding and reasoning
in spoken language. MMSU comprises 5,000 meticulously curated
audio-question-answer triplets across 47 distinct tasks. To ground our
benchmark in linguistic theory, we systematically incorporate a wide range of
linguistic phenomena, including phonetics, prosody, rhetoric, syntactics,
semantics, and paralinguistics. Through a rigorous evaluation of 14 advanced
SpeechLLMs, we identify substantial room for improvement in existing models,
highlighting meaningful directions for future optimization. MMSU establishes a
new standard for comprehensive assessment of spoken language understanding,
providing valuable insights for developing more sophisticated human-AI speech
interaction systems. MMSU benchmark is available at

Motivation: 填补现有文献中对多模态输入如何与语言主干连接的空白，为研究者提供结构化的概述。

Method: 通过分析125个MLLMs，提出分类框架，包括架构策略、表示学习技术和训练范式。

Result: 总结了当前集成技术的模式，为未来模型的开发提供了指导。

Conclusion: 该分类框架为构建更鲁棒的多模态集成策略提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) has transformed
the AI landscape. These models combine pre-trained LLMs with various modality
encoders. This integration requires a systematic understanding of how different
modalities connect to the language backbone. Our survey presents an LLM-centric
analysis of current approaches. We examine methods for transforming and
aligning diverse modal inputs into the language embedding space. This addresses
a significant gap in existing literature. We propose a classification framework
for MLLMs based on three key dimensions. First, we examine architectural
strategies for modality integration. This includes both the specific
integration mechanisms and the fusion level. Second, we categorize
representation learning techniques as either joint or coordinate
representations. Third, we analyze training paradigms, including training
strategies and objective functions. By examining 125 MLLMs developed between
2021 and 2025, we identify emerging patterns in the field. Our taxonomy
provides researchers with a structured overview of current integration
techniques. These insights aim to guide the development of more robust
multimodal integration strategies for future models built on pre-trained
foundations.

TL;DR: FineLogic是一个细粒度的评估框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑推理能力，涵盖准确性、步骤合理性和表示对齐三个维度。研究发现，自然语言监督在泛化性上表现优越，而符号推理风格则促进结构更严谨的推理链。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅依赖最终答案准确性，无法全面评估推理过程的质量和结构，因此需要更精细的评估方法。

Method: 提出FineLogic框架，并在四种监督风格（一种自然语言和三种符号变体）下训练LLMs，分析其推理能力。

Result: 自然语言监督在泛化和长上下文任务中表现优异，符号推理风格则生成更结构化的推理链。表示级分析显示微调主要通过逐步生成改善推理行为。

Conclusion: FineLogic为LLMs的逻辑推理评估和改进提供了更严谨和可解释的视角。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a core capability for many applications of large
language models (LLMs), yet existing benchmarks often rely solely on
final-answer accuracy, failing to capture the quality and structure of the
reasoning process. We propose FineLogic, a fine-grained evaluation framework
that assesses logical reasoning across three dimensions: overall benchmark
accuracy, stepwise soundness, and representation-level alignment. In addition,
to better understand how reasoning capabilities emerge, we conduct a
comprehensive study on the effects of supervision format during fine-tuning. We
construct four supervision styles (one natural language and three symbolic
variants) and train LLMs under each. Our findings reveal that natural language
supervision yields strong generalization even on out-of-distribution and
long-context tasks, while symbolic reasoning styles promote more structurally
sound and atomic inference chains. Further, our representation-level probing
shows that fine-tuning primarily improves reasoning behaviors through
step-by-step generation, rather than enhancing shortcut prediction or
internalized correctness. Together, our framework and analysis provide a more
rigorous and interpretable lens for evaluating and improving logical reasoning
in LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合CNN和BERT的混合方法，用于机器翻译校对，通过端到端训练实现高效错误检测和修正，性能优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动翻译可能存在错误，需要人工校对，因此需要一种高效的机器翻译校对方法以提高质量。

Method: 结合CNN和BERT，CNN用于捕捉局部n-gram模式，BERT用于生成上下文丰富的序列表示，并通过注意力机制检测错误。修正模块使用GRU解码器和翻译记忆库提出合理修改。

Result: 实验结果显示90%的准确率、89.37%的F1分数和16.24%的MSE，性能优于现有技术10%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法在识别和修正翻译错误方面表现出色，达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Since automatic translations can contain errors that require substantial
human post-editing, machine translation proofreading is essential for improving
quality. This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for robust proofreading
that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT). In order to extract semantic
information from phrases and expressions, CNN uses a variety of convolution
kernel filters to capture local n-gram patterns. In the meanwhile, BERT creates
context-rich representations of whole sequences by utilizing stacked
bidirectional transformer encoders. Using BERT's attention processes, the
integrated error detection component relates tokens to spot translation
irregularities including word order problems and omissions. The correction
module then uses parallel English-German alignment and GRU decoder models in
conjunction with translation memory to propose logical modifications that
maintain original meaning. A unified end-to-end training process optimized for
post-editing performance is applied to the whole pipeline. The multi-domain
collection of WMT and the conversational dialogues of Open-Subtitles are two of
the English-German parallel corpora used to train the model. Multiple loss
functions supervise detection and correction capabilities. Experiments attain a
90% accuracy, 89.37% F1, and 16.24% MSE, exceeding recent proofreading
techniques by over 10% overall. Comparative benchmarking demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance in identifying and coherently rectifying
mistranslations and omissions.

Motivation: 探索VLM和LLM在真实课堂环境（尤其是教育资源不足地区）中的教育评估效果。

Method: 使用VLM和多个LLM对646份印尼四年级学生的手写考试答卷（数学和英语）进行评估，涵盖选择题、简答题和作文题。

Result: VLM在手写识别上表现不佳，影响LLM评分准确性，但LLM生成的反馈仍有一定实用性。

Conclusion: VLM和LLM在教育评估中有潜力，但手写识别和个性化反馈仍需改进。

Abstract: Although vision-language and large language models (VLM and LLM) offer
promising opportunities for AI-driven educational assessment, their
effectiveness in real-world classroom settings, particularly in
underrepresented educational contexts, remains underexplored. In this study, we
evaluated the performance of a state-of-the-art VLM and several LLMs on 646
handwritten exam responses from grade 4 students in six Indonesian schools,
covering two subjects: Mathematics and English. These sheets contain more than
14K student answers that span multiple choice, short answer, and essay
questions. Assessment tasks include grading these responses and generating
personalized feedback. Our findings show that the VLM often struggles to
accurately recognize student handwriting, leading to error propagation in
downstream LLM grading. Nevertheless, LLM-generated feedback retains some
utility, even when derived from imperfect input, although limitations in
personalization and contextual relevance persist.

Result: 在Cryptonite数据集上实现了新的最优性能，验证了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: 该系统不仅性能优越，还提供了可解释的推理过程，为加密填字游戏的研究和应用提供了新工具。

Abstract: Cryptic crossword clues are challenging language tasks for which new test
sets are released daily by major newspapers on a global basis. Each cryptic
clue contains both the definition of the answer to be placed in the crossword
grid (in common with regular crosswords), and 'wordplay' that proves that the
answer is correct (i.e. a human solver can be confident that an answer is
correct without needing crossing words as confirmation). This work describes an
LLM-based reasoning system built from open-licensed components that solves
cryptic clues by (i) hypothesising answers; (ii) proposing wordplay
explanations; and (iii) using a verifier system that operates on codified
reasoning steps. Overall, this system establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Cryptonite dataset of clues from The Times and
The Telegraph newspapers in the UK. Because each proved solution is expressed
in Python, interpretable wordplay reasoning for proven answers is available for
inspection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法主要关注答案层面的不确定性，难以检测推理过程中的冗余或逻辑不一致问题，而这些问题在LRMs中尤为关键。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过提取关键推理步骤并计算四个诊断信号（推理一致性、答案不确定性、语义对齐和内部一致性）进行细粒度检测。

Result: 实验表明，RACE在多个数据集和LLMs上优于现有基线，提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Conclusion: RACE为LRMs的幻觉检测提供了有效工具，显著提升了透明度和性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) extend large language models with explicit,
multi-step reasoning traces to enhance transparency and performance on complex
tasks. However, these reasoning traces can be redundant or logically
inconsistent, making them a new source of hallucination that is difficult to
detect. Existing hallucination detection methods focus primarily on
answer-level uncertainty and often fail to detect hallucinations or logical
inconsistencies arising from the model's reasoning trace. This oversight is
particularly problematic for LRMs, where the explicit thinking trace is not
only an important support to the model's decision-making process but also a key
source of potential hallucination. To this end, we propose RACE (Reasoning and
Answer Consistency Evaluation), a novel framework specifically tailored for
hallucination detection in LRMs. RACE operates by extracting essential
reasoning steps and computing four diagnostic signals: inter-sample consistency
of reasoning traces, entropy-based answer uncertainty, semantic alignment
between reasoning and answers, and internal coherence of reasoning. This joint
analysis enables fine-grained hallucination detection even when the final
answer appears correct. Experiments across datasets and different LLMs
demonstrate that RACE outperforms existing hallucination detection baselines,
offering a robust and generalizable solution for evaluating LRMs. Our code is
available at: https://github.com/bebr2/RACE.

Result: 发布了包含7小时5种欧洲语言录音的MockConf数据集，以及InterAlign工具和自动对齐基线。

Conclusion: MockConf和InterAlign为同声传译的研究提供了新资源，支持自动分析和评估。

Abstract: In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter renders a source speech into
another language with a very short lag, much sooner than sentences are
finished. In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex
task automatically, we need dedicated datasets and tools for analysis,
monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for
their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and
associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model
long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of
divergences (e.g., shortening, simplification, functional generalization)
between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we introduce
MockConf, a student interpreting dataset that was collected from Mock
Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7
hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the
level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern
web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long
inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting. We propose metrics for
the evaluation and a baseline for automatic alignment. Dataset and tools are
released to the community.

Motivation: 手动生成MCQs耗时耗力，LLMs为教育者提供了高效解决方案。

Method: 通过向LLMs注入知识而非依赖其固有知识，对比三种模型生成MCQs的效果，并由21名教育者评估。

Result: GPT-3.5在生成MCQs方面表现最优，但教育领域对AI的接受度仍有待提高。

Conclusion: LLMs在生成MCQs方面具有潜力，可为教育体验带来改进，但需进一步推广AI的应用。

Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) in educational settings has brought
new learning approaches, transforming the practices of both students and
educators. Among the various technologies driving this transformation, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for creating educational
materials and question answering, but there are still space for new
applications. Educators commonly use Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to assess
student knowledge, but manually generating these questions is
resource-intensive and requires significant time and cognitive effort. In our
opinion, LLMs offer a promising solution to these challenges. This paper
presents a novel comparative analysis of three widely known LLMs - Llama 2,
Mistral, and GPT-3.5 - to explore their potential for creating informative and
challenging MCQs. In our approach, we do not rely on the knowledge of the LLM,
but we inject the knowledge into the prompt to contrast the hallucinations,
giving the educators control over the test's source text, too. Our experiment
involving 21 educators shows that GPT-3.5 generates the most effective MCQs
across several known metrics. Additionally, it shows that there is still some
reluctance to adopt AI in the educational field. This study sheds light on the
potential of LLMs to generate MCQs and improve the educational experience,
providing valuable insights for the future.

Motivation: 探索在IWSLT等长共享任务条件下，大型语言模型（LLMs）在翻译任务中的表现及其对输出长度控制的能力。

Method: 使用8种不同规模的开源LLMs，分析不同提示策略、少量示例数量及演示选择对翻译的影响。

Result: 指令措辞与演示对齐对长度控制至关重要；极端示例能缩短翻译，而等长演示易忽略长度约束；少量提示提升质量但边际效益递减；多输出可优化长度与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: 提示策略和演示选择显著影响翻译质量和长度控制，多输出方法在某些语言对中达到最优性能。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the effectiveness of isometric machine translation
across multiple language pairs (En$\to$De, En$\to$Fr, and En$\to$Es) under the
conditions of the IWSLT Isometric Shared Task 2022. Using eight open-source
large language models (LLMs) of varying sizes, we investigate how different
prompting strategies, varying numbers of few-shot examples, and demonstration
selection influence translation quality and length control. We discover that
the phrasing of instructions, when aligned with the properties of the provided
demonstrations, plays a crucial role in controlling the output length. Our
experiments show that LLMs tend to produce shorter translations only when
presented with extreme examples, while isometric demonstrations often lead to
the models disregarding length constraints. While few-shot prompting generally
enhances translation quality, further improvements are marginal across 5, 10,
and 20-shot settings. Finally, considering multiple outputs allows to notably
improve overall tradeoff between the length and quality, yielding
state-of-the-art performance for some language pairs.

Method: 将UD整合到预训练语言模型中，并在跨语言对抗性释义识别任务中评估其效果。

Result: UD的整合显著提升了模型性能，准确率和F1分数分别平均提高了3.85%和6.08%，并在某些语言对上超越了大语言模型。

Conclusion: UD在跨领域任务中具有有效性和潜力，其与英语的相似性得分与模型性能呈正相关。

Abstract: Universal Dependencies (UD), while widely regarded as the most successful
linguistic framework for cross-lingual syntactic representation, remains
underexplored in terms of its effectiveness. This paper addresses this gap by
integrating UD into pretrained language models and assesses if UD can improve
their performance on a cross-lingual adversarial paraphrase identification
task. Experimental results show that incorporation of UD yields significant
improvements in accuracy and $F_1$ scores, with average gains of 3.85\% and
6.08\% respectively. These enhancements reduce the performance gap between
pretrained models and large language models in some language pairs, and even
outperform the latter in some others. Furthermore, the UD-based similarity
score between a given language and English is positively correlated to the
performance of models in that language. Both findings highlight the validity
and potential of UD in out-of-domain tasks.

*Shiyi Xu,Yiwen Hu,Yingqian Min,Zhipeng Chen,Wayne Xin Zhao,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ICPC-Eval，一个用于评估大型语言模型在竞赛环境中编码能力的新基准，解决了现有基准和指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和指标无法充分评估大型语言模型在真实竞赛环境中的编码和反思能力。

Method: ICPC-Eval包含118个精心挑选的ICPC竞赛题目，提供真实竞赛场景、本地评估工具和新的评估指标Refine@K。

Result: 结果显示，顶级推理模型依赖多轮代码反馈才能发挥潜力，但仍落后于顶尖人类团队。

Conclusion: ICPC-Eval为评估复杂推理能力提供了有效工具，揭示了模型与人类之间的差距。

Abstract: With the significant progress of large reasoning models in complex coding and
reasoning tasks, existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and CodeElo, are
insufficient to evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) in real competition environments. Moreover, current evaluation metrics
such as Pass@K fail to capture the reflective abilities of reasoning models. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ICPC-Eval}, a top-level
competitive coding benchmark designed to probing the frontiers of LLM
reasoning. ICPC-Eval includes 118 carefully curated problems from 11 recent
ICPC contests held in various regions of the world, offering three key
contributions: 1) A challenging realistic ICPC competition scenario, featuring
a problem type and difficulty distribution consistent with actual contests. 2)
A robust test case generation method and a corresponding local evaluation
toolkit, enabling efficient and accurate local evaluation. 3) An effective
test-time scaling evaluation metric, Refine@K, which allows iterative repair of
solutions based on execution feedback. The results underscore the significant
challenge in evaluating complex reasoning abilities: top-tier reasoning models
like DeepSeek-R1 often rely on multi-turn code feedback to fully unlock their
in-context reasoning potential when compared to non-reasoning counterparts.
Furthermore, despite recent advancements in code generation, these models still
lag behind top-performing human teams. We release the benchmark at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Verbose ListOps是一个新的基准测试，通过将ListOps计算转化为长故事，测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的表现，揭示了LLMs在状态管理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能有效测试LLMs在嵌套叙事推理中的能力，掩盖了其根本局限性。Verbose ListOps旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过程序化生成长故事形式的ListOps计算，迫使LLMs进行内部计算和状态管理，同时控制叙事长度和推理难度。

Result: 实验显示，主流LLMs在Verbose ListOps上表现不佳，尤其是在中等长度叙事中，尽管能轻松解决原始ListOps问题。

Conclusion: Verbose ListOps揭示了LLMs在嵌套推理中的关键弱点，为未来改进提供了方向，尤其是在知识自动化领域。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), whilst great at extracting facts from text,
struggle with nested narrative reasoning. Existing long context and multi-hop
QA benchmarks inadequately test this, lacking realistic distractors or failing
to decouple context length from reasoning complexity, masking a fundamental LLM
limitation. We introduce Verbose ListOps, a novel benchmark that
programmatically transposes ListOps computations into lengthy, coherent
stories. This uniquely forces internal computation and state management of
nested reasoning problems by withholding intermediate results, and offers
fine-grained controls for both narrative size \emph{and} reasoning difficulty.
Whilst benchmarks like LongReason (2025) advance approaches for synthetically
expanding the context size of multi-hop QA problems, Verbose ListOps pinpoints
a specific LLM vulnerability: difficulty in state management for nested
sub-reasoning amongst semantically-relevant, distracting narrative. Our
experiments show that leading LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o4, Gemini 2.5 Pro) collapse
in performance on Verbose ListOps at modest (~10k token) narrative lengths,
despite effortlessly solving raw ListOps equations. Addressing this failure is
paramount for real-world text interpretation which requires identifying key
reasoning points, tracking conceptual intermediate results, and filtering
irrelevant information. Verbose ListOps, and its extensible generation
framework thus enables targeted reasoning enhancements beyond mere
context-window expansion; a critical step to automating the world's knowledge
work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前普遍认为微调多语言端到端模型是低资源语言ASR系统的最佳方法，但本文质疑这一观点，并提出更优方案。

Method: 结合混合HMM和自监督模型，通过持续的自监督预训练和半监督训练，充分利用所有可用的语音和文本数据。

Result: 在苏格兰盖尔语上测试，相对最佳微调Whisper模型，词错误率降低了32%。

Conclusion: 混合HMM与自监督模型的结合在低资源语言ASR系统中表现更优，挑战了现有微调方法的优越性。

Abstract: An effective approach to the development of ASR systems for low-resource
languages is to fine-tune an existing multilingual end-to-end model. When the
original model has been trained on large quantities of data from many
languages, fine-tuning can be effective with limited training data, even when
the language in question was not present in the original training data. The
fine-tuning approach has been encouraged by the availability of public-domain
E2E models and is widely believed to lead to state-of-the-art results. This
paper, however, challenges that belief. We show that an approach combining
hybrid HMMs with self-supervised models can yield substantially better
performance with limited training data. This combination allows better
utilisation of all available speech and text data through continued
self-supervised pre-training and semi-supervised training. We benchmark our
approach on Scottish Gaelic, achieving WER reductions of 32% relative over our
best fine-tuned Whisper model.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言数学推理任务中提供教学反馈的能力，发现多语言提示能显著提升学习效果，尤其是在低资源语言中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在不同语言中提供有效教学支持的能力，尤其是在数学推理任务中。

Method: 通过模拟多语言师生互动，使用强模型作为导师生成提示，弱模型模拟学生，探索11种语言、4种LLMs及多种提示策略。

Result: 多语言提示显著改善学习效果，尤其是当反馈与学生母语一致时。

Conclusion: 研究为开发多语言LLM教育工具提供了实用见解，强调反馈语言与学生母语一致的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate
formative feedback and instructional hints in English, making them increasingly
relevant for AI-assisted education. However, their ability to provide effective
instructional support across different languages, especially for mathematically
grounded reasoning tasks, remains largely unexamined. In this work, we present
the first large-scale simulation of multilingual tutor-student interactions
using LLMs. A stronger model plays the role of the tutor, generating feedback
in the form of hints, while a weaker model simulates the student. We explore
352 experimental settings across 11 typologically diverse languages, four
state-of-the-art LLMs, and multiple prompting strategies to assess whether
language-specific feedback leads to measurable learning gains. Our study
examines how student input language, teacher feedback language, model choice,
and language resource level jointly influence performance. Results show that
multilingual hints can significantly improve learning outcomes, particularly in
low-resource languages when feedback is aligned with the student's native
language. These findings offer practical insights for developing multilingual,
LLM-based educational tools that are both effective and inclusive.

Method: 创建了包含11,400句对的捷克语-波兰语电子商务数据集（ConECT），并测试了视觉语言模型（VLM）和文本到文本模型中融入上下文信息的方法。

Result: 实验表明，融入视觉和文本上下文信息显著提升了翻译质量。

Conclusion: 上下文信息的加入能有效改善机器翻译质量，并公开了新数据集以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has improved translation by using
Transformer-based models, but it still struggles with word ambiguity and
context. This problem is especially important in domain-specific applications,
which often have problems with unclear sentences or poor data quality. Our
research explores how adding information to models can improve translations in
the context of e-commerce data. To this end we create ConECT -- a new
Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and
product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs. We then investigate and
compare different methods that are applicable to context-aware translation. We
test a vision-language model (VLM), finding that visual context aids
translation quality. Additionally, we explore the incorporation of contextual
information into text-to-text models, such as the product's category path or
image descriptions. The results of our study demonstrate that the incorporation
of contextual information leads to an improvement in the quality of machine
translation. We make the new dataset publicly available.

Motivation: 解决在标注数据稀缺的情况下，如何利用未标注音频和相关领域标注数据来优化预训练ASR模型的领域适应性问题。

Method: 提出增量半监督学习流程，先整合小规模领域内标注数据和相关领域辅助数据，再通过多模型共识或命名实体识别筛选伪标签进行迭代优化。

Result: 在Wow呼叫中心和Fisher英语语料库上，该方法优于单步微调，共识筛选相对随机选择提升22.3%（Wow）和24.8%（Fisher）。

Conclusion: 共识筛选是最优方法，命名实体识别次之且计算成本更低，为稀缺标注数据下的ASR模型优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained ASR models for specific domains is challenging when
labeled data is scarce. But unlabeled audio and labeled data from related
domains are often available. We propose an incremental semi-supervised learning
pipeline that first integrates a small in-domain labeled set and an auxiliary
dataset from a closely related domain, achieving a relative improvement of 4%
over no auxiliary data. Filtering based on multi-model consensus or named
entity recognition (NER) is then applied to select and iteratively refine
pseudo-labels, showing slower performance saturation compared to random
selection. Evaluated on the multi-domain Wow call center and Fisher English
corpora, it outperforms single-step fine-tuning. Consensus-based filtering
outperforms other methods, providing up to 22.3% relative improvement on Wow
and 24.8% on Fisher over single-step fine-tuning with random selection. NER is
the second-best filter, providing competitive performance at a lower
computational cost.

TL;DR: 论文提出SCOP方法，从认知角度评估大语言模型（LLMs）的理解过程，发现LLMs难以达到专家级理解水平，且存在不可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在机器理解方面潜力巨大，但其理解过程是否与专家一致缺乏合理解释，因此需要系统评估。

Method: 提出SCOP方法，定义理解过程的五项必备技能，构建测试数据框架，并分析开源和闭源LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs难以实现专家级理解，但在局部信息理解上与专家相似；存在通过错误过程得出正确答案的不可靠性。

Conclusion: 改进LLMs的方向应关注理解过程，确保训练中全面培养所有理解技能。

Abstract: Despite the great potential of large language models(LLMs) in machine
comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world
scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for
whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In
this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the
comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with
a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension
process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a
detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the
testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to
perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs
share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending
local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs
can be somewhat unreliable -- they might reach correct answers through flawed
comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for
improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all
comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要复杂模型修改，限制了与预训练模型的兼容性，因此需要一种更简单且兼容性强的长度控制方法。

Method: 通过增加交叉熵损失中EOS令牌预测的重要性来控制生成文本的长度，无需复杂模型修改。

Result: 该方法在编码器-解码器和GPT风格的大语言模型中有效，能够控制生成长度且通常不影响摘要质量。

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单、兼容性强，适用于多种模型，且不影响生成质量。

Abstract: Controlling the length of generated text can be crucial in various
text-generation tasks, including summarization. Existing methods often require
complex model alterations, limiting compatibility with pre-trained models. We
address these limitations by developing a simple approach for controlling the
length of automatic text summaries by increasing the importance of correctly
predicting the EOS token in the cross-entropy loss computation. The proposed
methodology is agnostic to architecture and decoding algorithms and orthogonal
to other inference-time techniques to control the generation length. We tested
it with encoder-decoder and modern GPT-style LLMs, and show that this method
can control generation length, often without affecting the quality of the
summary.

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500等数学任务及MMLU等非数学任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: AR-Checker能动态生成测试基准，有效评估LLMs的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved distinguished performance on
various reasoning-intensive tasks. However, LLMs might still face the
challenges of robustness issues and fail unexpectedly in some simple reasoning
tasks. Previous works evaluate the LLM robustness with hand-crafted templates
or a limited set of perturbation rules, indicating potential data contamination
in pre-training or fine-tuning datasets. In this work, inspired by stress
testing in software engineering, we propose a novel framework, Automatic
Robustness Checker (AR-Checker), to generate mathematical problem variants that
maintain the semantic meanings of the original one but might fail the LLMs. The
AR-Checker framework generates mathematical problem variants through
multi-round parallel streams of LLM-based rewriting and verification. Our
framework can generate benchmark variants dynamically for each LLM, thus
minimizing the risk of data contamination. Experiments on GSM8K and MATH-500
demonstrate the strong performance of AR-Checker on mathematical tasks. We also
evaluate AR-Checker on benchmarks beyond mathematics, including MMLU, MMLU-Pro,
and CommonsenseQA, where it also achieves strong performance, further proving
the effectiveness of AR-Checker.

transforms low-resource inputs into high-resource representations, leveraging

Abstract: We introduce Debate Speech Evaluation as a novel and challenging benchmark
for assessing LLM judges. Evaluating debate speeches requires a deep
understanding of the speech at multiple levels, including argument strength and
relevance, the coherence and organization of the speech, the appropriateness of
its style and tone, and so on. This task involves a unique set of cognitive
abilities that have previously received limited attention in systematic LLM
benchmarking. To explore such skills, we leverage a dataset of over 600
meticulously annotated debate speeches and present the first in-depth analysis
of how state-of-the-art LLMs compare to human judges on this task. Our findings
reveal a nuanced picture: while larger models can approximate individual human
judgments in some respects, they differ substantially in their overall judgment
behavior. We also investigate the ability of frontier LLMs to generate
persuasive, opinionated speeches, showing that models may perform at a human
level on this task.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解LLMs的自我报告行为是否类似于人类的内省能力，尤其是在其语言流畅性和认知能力不断增强的背景下。

Method: 通过分析两个LLMs的自我报告案例，批判性地评估其是否具备内省能力。

Result: 第一个案例中，LLM描述其“创造性”写作过程，被认为不具备内省能力；第二个案例中，LLM正确推断其温度参数，被视为一种最小化的内省行为。

Conclusion: 结论是LLMs的某些行为可以视为内省，但缺乏意识体验，其内省能力与人类不同。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit compelling linguistic behaviour, and
sometimes offer self-reports, that is to say statements about their own nature,
inner workings, or behaviour. In humans, such reports are often attributed to a
faculty of introspection and are typically linked to consciousness. This raises
the question of how to interpret self-reports produced by LLMs, given their
increasing linguistic fluency and cognitive capabilities. To what extent (if
any) can the concept of introspection be meaningfully applied to LLMs? Here, we
present and critique two examples of apparent introspective self-report from
LLMs. In the first example, an LLM attempts to describe the process behind its
own ``creative'' writing, and we argue this is not a valid example of
introspection. In the second example, an LLM correctly infers the value of its
own temperature parameter, and we argue that this can be legitimately
considered a minimal example of introspection, albeit one that is (presumably)
not accompanied by conscious experience.

Motivation: 研究发现，离线奖励模型（RM）与在线LLM因分布偏移逐渐偏离，导致翻译任务表现不佳，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出RIVAL对抗训练框架，将RM与LLM建模为极小极大博弈，迭代更新两者，并结合定性与定量奖励。

Result: 实验表明，RIVAL显著提升了翻译基线性能。

Conclusion: RIVAL框架有效解决了分布偏移问题，提升了翻译质量，为类似任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess strong multilingual capabilities, and
combining Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) with translation
tasks has shown great potential. However, we observe that this paradigm
performs unexpectedly poorly when applied to colloquial subtitle translation
tasks. In this work, we investigate this issue and find that the offline reward
model (RM) gradually diverges from the online LLM due to distributional shift,
ultimately leading to undesirable training outcomes. To address this, we
propose RIVAL, an adversarial training framework that formulates the process as
a min-max game between the RM and the LLM. RIVAL iteratively updates the both
models, with the RM trained to distinguish strong from weak translations
(qualitative preference reward), and the LLM trained to enhance its translation
for closing this gap. To stabilize training and improve generalizability, we
also incorporate quantitative preference reward (e.g., BLEU) into the RM,
enabling reference-free quality modeling aligned with human evaluation. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed adversarial training
framework significantly improves upon translation baselines.

Abstract: Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and
mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle,
context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids
suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language
models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and
emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing
intent through nuanced language-emoji interplay. We present the Centennial
Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100), a curated set of 100 emojis with
contextual self-harm interpretations and the Self-Harm Identification aNd
intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering
detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious
intents (SIs). Our unified framework: a) enriches inputs using CESM-100; b)
fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning: self-harm detection (primary) and
CM/SI span detection (auxiliary); c) generates explainable rationales for
self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art
LLMs-Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama, across zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues,
our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and
explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm
signals. The SHINES dataset, CESM-100 and codebase are publicly available at:

*HaoTian Lan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于图像的可解释框架，分析中国哈尔滨社区街道的商业活力与车辆可达性、环境质量和行人感知的关系，发现适度车辆存在有助于商业，但过度停车会降低满意度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨社区街道商业活力的驱动因素，尤其是车辆、环境和行人感知的复杂互动。

Method: 利用街景图像和多模态大语言模型（VisualGLM-6B）构建商业活力指数（CCVI），并结合GPT-4的感知建模分析空间属性。

Result: 适度车辆存在提升商业可达性，但过度停车降低步行性和满意度；绿化和清洁度显著提高满意度，但对定价影响较弱；街道宽度调节车辆影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI辅助感知与城市形态分析结合的价值，为社区振兴提供了理论和工具支持。

Abstract: The commercial vitality of community-scale streets in Chinese cities is
shaped by complex interactions between vehicular accessibility, environmental
quality, and pedestrian perception. This study proposes an interpretable,
image-based framework to examine how street-level features -- including parked
vehicle density, greenery, cleanliness, and street width -- impact retail
performance and user satisfaction in Harbin, China. Leveraging street view
imagery and a multimodal large language model (VisualGLM-6B), we construct a
Community Commercial Vitality Index (CCVI) from Meituan and Dianping data and
analyze its relationship with spatial attributes extracted via GPT-4-based
perception modeling. Our findings reveal that while moderate vehicle presence
may enhance commercial access, excessive on-street parking -- especially in
narrow streets -- erodes walkability and reduces both satisfaction and
shop-level pricing. In contrast, streets with higher perceived greenery and
cleanliness show significantly greater satisfaction scores but only weak
associations with pricing. Street width moderates the effects of vehicle
presence, underscoring the importance of spatial configuration. These results
demonstrate the value of integrating AI-assisted perception with urban
morphological analysis to capture non-linear and context-sensitive drivers of
commercial success. This study advances both theoretical and methodological
frontiers by highlighting the conditional role of vehicle activity in
neighborhood commerce and demonstrating the feasibility of multimodal AI for
perceptual urban diagnostics. The implications extend to urban design, parking
management, and scalable planning tools for community revitalization.

*Tianyi Huang,Zikun Cui,Cuiqianhe Du,Chia-En Chiang*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合对比学习和隐式立场推理的新框架CL-ISR，用于提高社交媒体误导文本的检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上的误导文本可能导致公众误解、社会恐慌甚至经济损失，因此需要更有效的检测方法。

Method: 使用对比学习算法增强模型对语义差异的学习能力，并引入隐式立场推理模块探索文本中的潜在立场倾向。

Result: CL-ISR框架显著提高了误导文本的检测效果。

Conclusion: 结合对比学习和隐式立场推理的CL-ISR框架在检测社交媒体误导文本方面表现出色。

Abstract: Misleading text detection on social media platforms is a critical research
area, as these texts can lead to public misunderstanding, social panic and even
economic losses. This paper proposes a novel framework - CL-ISR (Contrastive
Learning and Implicit Stance Reasoning), which combines contrastive learning
and implicit stance reasoning, to improve the detection accuracy of misleading
texts on social media. First, we use the contrastive learning algorithm to
improve the model's learning ability of semantic differences between truthful
and misleading texts. Contrastive learning could help the model to better
capture the distinguishing features between different categories by
constructing positive and negative sample pairs. This approach enables the
model to capture distinguishing features more effectively, particularly in
linguistically complicated situations. Second, we introduce the implicit stance
reasoning module, to explore the potential stance tendencies in the text and
their relationships with related topics. This method is effective for
identifying content that misleads through stance shifting or emotional
manipulation, because it can capture the implicit information behind the text.
Finally, we integrate these two algorithms together to form a new framework,
CL-ISR, which leverages the discriminative power of contrastive learning and
the interpretive depth of stance reasoning to significantly improve detection
effect.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合wav2vec 2.0和Phi-4多模态大语言模型的系统，以克服BERT和W2V在口语评估中的局限性，并在比赛中取得第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT和Wav2vec 2.0在口语评估中各有限制，BERT依赖ASR转录而忽略声学特征，W2V缺乏语义解释性。

Method: 通过分数融合策略整合W2V和Phi-4多模态大语言模型。

Result: 在Speak & Improve Challenge 2025中，系统RMSE为0.375，排名第二。

Conclusion: 提出的系统有效结合了两种模型的优势，提升了口语评估的性能。

Abstract: A recent line of research on spoken language assessment (SLA) employs neural
models such as BERT and wav2vec 2.0 (W2V) to evaluate speaking proficiency
across linguistic and acoustic modalities. Although both models effectively
capture features relevant to oral competence, each exhibits modality-specific
limitations. BERT-based methods rely on ASR transcripts, which often fail to
capture prosodic and phonetic cues for SLA. In contrast, W2V-based methods
excel at modeling acoustic features but lack semantic interpretability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a system that integrates W2V with Phi-4
multimodal large language model (MLLM) through a score fusion strategy. The
proposed system achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.375 on the
official test set of the Speak & Improve Challenge 2025, securing second place
in the competition. For comparison, the RMSEs of the top-ranked, third-ranked,
and official baseline systems are 0.364, 0.384, and 0.444, respectively.

*Tanmay Parekh,Kartik Mehta,Ninareh Mehrabi,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiCoRe框架通过发散-收敛推理方法提升零样本事件检测性能，平均F1分数比最佳基线高4-7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本事件检测在专业领域中至关重要，但复杂事件本体和领域特定触发词限制了大型语言模型的应用。

Method: 提出DiCoRe框架，结合Dreamer（发散推理）和Grounder（收敛推理），并通过LLM-Judge验证输出。

Result: 在六个数据集和九个LLM上的实验显示，DiCoRe优于现有方法，平均F1分数提升4-7%。

Conclusion: DiCoRe是一种强大的零样本事件检测框架，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in
natural language text without any training data, is critical for document
understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them
appropriately overloads and limits the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs)
for zero-shot ED. To this end, we propose DiCoRe, a divergent-convergent
reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED
framework.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种量化框架，通过引入m-local熵来衡量语言模型的归纳偏置，发现高m-local熵的语言更难学习，表明神经语言模型与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨神经语言模型（LMs）的归纳偏置是否与人类处理约束一致，通过量化框架研究这些偏置的性质。

Method: 提出m-local熵作为信息论度量，基于平均损失上下文惊奇度，量化语言局部不确定性。在自然语言语料库和概率有限状态自动机（PFSAs）定义的语言上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，m-local熵较高的语言对Transformer和LSTM LMs更难学习。

Conclusion: 神经LMs与人类类似，对语言的局部统计结构高度敏感。

Abstract: Inductive biases are inherent in every machine learning system, shaping how
models generalize from finite data. In the case of neural language models
(LMs), debates persist as to whether these biases align with or diverge from
human processing constraints. To address this issue, we propose a quantitative
framework that allows for controlled investigations into the nature of these
biases. Within our framework, we introduce $m$-local entropy$\unicode{x2013}$an
information-theoretic measure derived from average lossy-context
surprisal$\unicode{x2013}$that captures the local uncertainty of a language by
quantifying how effectively the $m-1$ preceding symbols disambiguate the next
symbol. In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages
defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSAs), we show that languages
with higher $m$-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs
to learn. These results suggest that neural LMs, much like humans, are highly
sensitive to the local statistical structure of a language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LALMs的内部机制对解释其行为和提升性能至关重要。

Method: 通过词汇投影技术分析三种先进LALMs，追踪属性信息在层和标记位置的变化。

Result: 发现属性信息在识别失败时随层深减少，早期层解析属性与更高准确性相关，且LALMs依赖查询输入而非隐藏状态聚合信息。

Conclusion: 研究为听觉属性处理提供了新见解，并展示了改进LALMs的方法，为未来优化铺平道路。

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large audio-language models (LALMs)
is crucial for interpreting their behavior and improving performance. This work
presents the first in-depth analysis of how LALMs internally perceive and
recognize auditory attributes. By applying vocabulary projection on three
state-of-the-art LALMs, we track how attribute information evolves across
layers and token positions. We find that attribute information generally
decreases with layer depth when recognition fails, and that resolving
attributes at earlier layers correlates with better accuracy. Moreover, LALMs
heavily rely on querying auditory inputs for predicting attributes instead of
aggregating necessary information in hidden states at attribute-mentioning
positions. Based on our findings, we demonstrate a method to enhance LALMs. Our
results offer insights into auditory attribute processing, paving the way for
future improvements.

*Diege Sun,Guanyi Chen,Fan Zhao,Xiaorong Cheng,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为自动评估器在自然语言生成中应用广泛，但其是否能准确复制人类对错误严重性的判断尚不明确。本研究比较了人类和LLMs对包含控制语义错误的图像描述的评价，发现LLMs在性别和颜色错误上的评分与人类存在显著差异，只有Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现出较高的人类对齐性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能准确复制人类对错误严重性的判断，尤其是在多模态和单模态设置下对不同类型错误的评估。

Method: 扩展van Miltenburg等人的实验框架，在单模态和多模态设置下评估四种错误类型（年龄、性别、服装类型、服装颜色），比较人类和LLMs的评分差异。

Result: 人类对不同错误类型的严重性评分有显著差异，视觉上下文对颜色和类型错误的严重性感知有放大作用。LLMs在性别和颜色错误上的评分与人类不一致，只有Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现出较高的人类对齐性。

Conclusion: LLMs在复制人类对错误严重性的判断上存在局限性，尤其是在缺乏感知基础的情况下。Doubao和DeepSeek-V3表现出较好的人类对齐性，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated evaluators in
natural language generation, yet it remains unclear whether they can accurately
replicate human judgments of error severity. In this study, we systematically
compare human and LLM assessments of image descriptions containing controlled
semantic errors. We extend the experimental framework of van Miltenburg et al.
(2020) to both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text + image) settings,
evaluating four error types: age, gender, clothing type, and clothing colour.
Our findings reveal that humans assign varying levels of severity to different
error types, with visual context significantly amplifying perceived severity
for colour and type errors. Notably, most LLMs assign low scores to gender
errors but disproportionately high scores to colour errors, unlike humans, who
judge both as highly severe but for different reasons. This suggests that these
models may have internalised social norms influencing gender judgments but lack
the perceptual grounding to emulate human sensitivity to colour, which is
shaped by distinct neural mechanisms. Only one of the evaluated LLMs, Doubao,
replicates the human-like ranking of error severity, but it fails to
distinguish between error types as clearly as humans. Surprisingly,
DeepSeek-V3, a unimodal LLM, achieves the highest alignment with human
judgments across both unimodal and multimodal conditions, outperforming even
state-of-the-art multimodal models.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统过于依赖检索上下文，可能忽视模型固有知识，尤其在处理误导性或冗余信息时表现不佳。

Method: 提出Knowledgeable-r1，采用联合采样和多策略分布，探索模型的知识能力，促进其对参数化和上下文知识的自我整合利用。

Result: 实验表明，Knowledgeable-r1在参数和上下文冲突任务及一般RAG任务中显著提升性能，尤其在反事实场景中优于基线17.07%。

Conclusion: Knowledgeable-r1有效解决了RAG系统中知识利用不平衡的问题，并在多种任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a mainstream method for improving
performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However,current RAG systems often
place too much emphasis on retrieved contexts. This can lead to reliance on
inaccurate sources and overlook the model's inherent knowledge, especially when
dealing with misleading or excessive information. To resolve this imbalance, we
propose Knowledgeable-r1 that using joint sampling and define multi policy
distributions in knowledge capability exploration to stimulate large language
models'self-integrated utilization of parametric and contextual knowledge.
Experiments show that Knowledgeable-r1 significantly enhances robustness and
reasoning accuracy in both parameters and contextual conflict tasks and general
RAG tasks, especially outperforming baselines by 17.07% in counterfactual
scenarios and demonstrating consistent gains across RAG tasks. Our code are

TL;DR: 论文通过机制解释性方法分析LLM中的社会、人口和性别偏见，发现偏见计算高度集中在少数层，移除这些组件会影响其他NLP任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM（如GPT-2和Llama2）中社会、人口和性别偏见的内部结构表示，以理解偏见的来源和影响。

Method: 采用机制解释性方法，通过不同指标识别导致偏见的内部组件，并评估其稳定性、定位性和泛化性。通过系统消融实验分析这些组件的影响。

Result: 偏见计算集中在少数层，且这些组件在微调设置中会变化。移除偏见组件不仅减少偏见输出，还会影响其他NLP任务。

Conclusion: 偏见在LLM中高度局部化，移除偏见组件可能对其他任务产生意外影响，需谨慎处理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit social, demographic, and
gender biases, often as a consequence of the data on which they are trained. In
this work, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to analyze how such
biases are structurally represented within models such as GPT-2 and Llama2.
Focusing on demographic and gender biases, we explore different metrics to
identify the internal edges responsible for biased behavior. We then assess the
stability, localization, and generalizability of these components across
dataset and linguistic variations. Through systematic ablations, we demonstrate
that bias-related computations are highly localized, often concentrated in a
small subset of layers. Moreover, the identified components change across
fine-tuning settings, including those unrelated to bias. Finally, we show that
removing these components not only reduces biased outputs but also affects
other NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition and linguistic acceptability
judgment because of the sharing of important components with these tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩方法未过滤非证据信息，限制了LLM在RAG中的表现。

Result: 实验表明ECoRAG在ODQA任务中优于现有压缩方法，且成本效益高。

Conclusion: ECoRAG通过保留必要信息提升性能，同时降低计算开销。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain
Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer
context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods
do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the
performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or
\textbf{ECoRAG} framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing
retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation
is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects
whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not,
retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM
performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods.
Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency
but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to
generate the correct answer. Code is available at

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Qwen3 Embedding series, a significant
advancement over its predecessor, the GTE-Qwen series, in text embedding and
reranking capabilities, built upon the Qwen3 foundation models. Leveraging the
Qwen3 LLMs' robust capabilities in multilingual text understanding and
generation, our innovative multi-stage training pipeline combines large-scale
unsupervised pre-training with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality datasets.
Effective model merging strategies further ensure the robustness and
adaptability of the Qwen3 Embedding series. During the training process, the
Qwen3 LLMs serve not only as backbone models but also play a crucial role in
synthesizing high-quality, rich, and diverse training data across multiple
domains and languages, thus enhancing the training pipeline. The Qwen3
Embedding series offers a spectrum of model sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) for both
embedding and reranking tasks, addressing diverse deployment scenarios where
users can optimize for either efficiency or effectiveness. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that the Qwen3 Embedding series achieves
state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks. Notably, it excels on the
multilingual evaluation benchmark MTEB for text embedding, as well as in
various retrieval tasks, including code retrieval, cross-lingual retrieval and
multilingual retrieval. To facilitate reproducibility and promote
community-driven research and development, the Qwen3 Embedding models are

Abstract: Large-scale neural language models (LMs) exhibit remarkable performance in
in-context learning: the ability to learn and reason the input context on the
fly without parameter update. This work studies in-context counterfactual
reasoning in language models, that is, to predict the consequences of changes
under hypothetical scenarios. We focus on studying a well-defined synthetic
setup: a linear regression task that requires noise abduction, where accurate
prediction is based on inferring and copying the contextual noise from factual
observations. We show that language models are capable of counterfactual
reasoning in this controlled setup and provide insights that counterfactual
reasoning for a broad class of functions can be reduced to a transformation on
in-context observations; we find self-attention, model depth, and data
diversity in pre-training drive performance in Transformers. More
interestingly, our findings extend beyond regression tasks and show that
Transformers can perform noise abduction on sequential data, providing
preliminary evidence on the potential for counterfactual story generation. Our

TL;DR: RELIC框架用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的指令跟随能力，通过语言识别任务测试模型在复杂语法下的表现。研究发现，即使最先进的LLM在复杂任务中也表现不佳，倾向于依赖浅层启发式方法。


<details>

Motivation: 评估LLM仅基于任务说明（无输入输出示例）执行任务的能力，即指令跟随能力。

Method: 引入RELIC框架，利用语言识别任务（判断字符串是否符合形式语法）测试LLM，任务复杂度可调。

Result: LLM的准确率与语法和字符串复杂度相关，复杂任务中表现接近随机猜测，且倾向于使用浅层启发式方法。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在复杂指令跟随任务中表现有限，RELIC框架为诊断模型行为提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to perform tasks based
only on a specification of the task provided in context, without examples of
inputs and outputs; this ability is referred to as instruction following. We
introduce the Recognition of Languages In-Context (RELIC) framework to evaluate
instruction following using language recognition: the task of determining if a
string is generated by formal grammar. Unlike many standard evaluations of
LLMs' ability to use their context, this task requires composing together a
large number of instructions (grammar productions) retrieved from the context.
Because the languages are synthetic, the task can be increased in complexity as
LLMs' skills improve, and new instances can be automatically generated,
mitigating data contamination. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on RELIC and
find that their accuracy can be reliably predicted from the complexity of the
grammar and the individual example strings, and that even the most advanced
LLMs currently available show near-chance performance on more complex grammars
and samples, in line with theoretical expectations. We also use RELIC to
diagnose how LLMs attempt to solve increasingly difficult reasoning tasks,
finding that as the complexity of the language recognition task increases,
models switch to relying on shallow heuristics instead of following complex
instructions.

Conclusion: Common Pile v0.1为开放许可文本的LLM训练提供了可行解决方案，并公开了数据集、代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on enormous quantities of
unlicensed text, a practice that has led to scrutiny due to possible
intellectual property infringement and ethical concerns. Training LLMs on
openly licensed text presents a first step towards addressing these issues, but
prior data collection efforts have yielded datasets too small or low-quality to
produce performant LLMs. To address this gap, we collect, curate, and release
the Common Pile v0.1, an eight terabyte collection of openly licensed text
designed for LLM pretraining. The Common Pile comprises content from 30 sources
that span diverse domains including research papers, code, books,
encyclopedias, educational materials, audio transcripts, and more. Crucially,
we validate our efforts by training two 7 billion parameter LLMs on text from
the Common Pile: Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, trained on 1 and 2 trillion
tokens respectively. Both models attain competitive performance to LLMs trained
on unlicensed text with similar computational budgets, such as Llama 1 and 2
7B. In addition to releasing the Common Pile v0.1 itself, we also release the
code used in its creation as well as the training mixture and checkpoints for
the Comma v0.1 models.

### [199] [Improving Low-Resource Morphological Inflection via Self-Supervised Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05227)

TL;DR: 论文研究了在极低资源环境下，自监督辅助任务对形态屈折（字符级任务）的有效性，发现自动编码在数据极少时表现最佳，而字符掩码语言模型（CMLM）在数据增加时更有效。基于已知语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督目标在字符级任务（如形态屈折）中的有效性，尤其是在资源稀缺的语言中，以推动语言文档化相关任务的发展。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器变换器模型，在19种语言和13种辅助目标上进行实验，比较不同自监督任务（如自动编码和CMLM）的表现。

Result: 自动编码在数据极少时表现最佳，CMLM在数据增加时更有效；基于语素边界的掩码采样能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: 自监督任务在低资源形态建模中具有潜力，尤其是结合语素边界信息的掩码策略。

Abstract: Self-supervised objectives have driven major advances in NLP by leveraging
large-scale unlabeled data, but such resources are scarce for many of the
world's languages. Surprisingly, they have not been explored much for
character-level tasks, where smaller amounts of data have the potential to be
beneficial. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks
for morphological inflection -- a character-level task highly relevant for
language documentation -- in extremely low-resource settings, training
encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives.
Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited,
while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data
availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases
influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM.
However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently
improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource
morphological modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一表示自然语言连续和非连续结构的系统，结合了短语结构语法、依存语法和范畴语法的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同语言学框架对非连续结构的独立分析方法，试图找到一种统一的方法。

Method: 结合短语结构语法（PSG）的构成性、依存语法（DG）的头-依存关系及范畴语法（CG）的函子-论元关系，提出统一的数学推导方法。

Result: 展示了非连续和连续结构可以通过统一的数学推导进行分析。

Conclusion: 证明了三种语法形式可以统一应用于自然语言结构的分析。

Abstract: Syntactic discontinuity is a grammatical phenomenon in which a constituent is
split into more than one part because of the insertion of an element which is
not part of the constituent. This is observed in many languages across the
world such as Turkish, Russian, Japanese, Warlpiri, Navajo, Hopi, Dyirbal,
Yidiny etc. Different formalisms/frameworks in current linguistic theory
approach the problem of discontinuous structures in different ways. Each
framework/formalism has widely been viewed as an independent and non-converging
system of analysis. In this paper, we propose a unified system of
representation for both continuity and discontinuity in structures of natural
languages by taking into account three formalisms, in particular, Phrase
Structure Grammar (PSG) for its widely used notion of constituency, Dependency
Grammar (DG) for its head-dependent relations, and Categorial Grammar (CG) for
its focus on functor-argument relations. We attempt to show that discontinuous
expressions as well as continuous structures can be analysed through a unified
mathematical derivation incorporating the representations of linguistic
structure in these three grammar formalisms.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种系统化的推理方法，通过分解文本并验证每个子事实的证据，提升LLM在幻觉检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法通常将任务视为自然语言推理（NLI），但复杂的推理任务需要更明确的推理过程以提高准确性。

Method: 定义了一个三步推理过程：声明分解、子声明归因与蕴含分类、聚合分类，并通过中间步骤的质量评估验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，这种系统化的推理方法显著提高了幻觉检测的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过引导模型进行更细致的推理，可以有效提升幻觉检测任务的性能。

Abstract: A common approach to hallucination detection casts it as a natural language
inference (NLI) task, often using LLMs to classify whether the generated text
is entailed by corresponding reference texts. Since entailment classification
is a complex reasoning task, one would expect that LLMs could benefit from
generating an explicit reasoning process, as in CoT reasoning or the explicit
``thinking'' of recent reasoning models. In this work, we propose that guiding
such models to perform a systematic and comprehensive reasoning process -- one
that both decomposes the text into smaller facts and also finds evidence in the
source for each fact -- allows models to execute much finer-grained and
accurate entailment decisions, leading to increased performance. To that end,
we define a 3-step reasoning process, consisting of (i) claim decomposition,
(ii) sub-claim attribution and entailment classification, and (iii) aggregated
classification, showing that such guided reasoning indeed yields improved
hallucination detection. Following this reasoning framework, we introduce an
analysis scheme, consisting of several metrics that measure the quality of the
intermediate reasoning steps, which provided additional empirical evidence for
the improved quality of our guided reasoning scheme.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统中外部检索知识与LLM内部知识冲突影响下游任务性能，现有方法因上下文冗长而效果不佳。

Method: 提出Micro-Act框架，通过分层动作空间感知上下文复杂度并分解知识源为细粒度比较步骤。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，Micro-Act显著优于现有方法，尤其在时间和语义冲突类型上表现突出。

Conclusion: Micro-Act不仅能有效解决知识冲突，还在非冲突问题上表现稳健，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from Knowledge
Conflicts, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent,
parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects
performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing
approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two
knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with
extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify
and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose Micro-Act a
framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context
complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of
fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable
steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves
significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all
5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types
where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits
robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its
practical value in real-world RAG applications.

Motivation: 多AI代理协作工作流常因提示设计不佳导致错误传播和性能低下，限制了系统的可靠性和扩展性。

Method: ProRefine利用大型语言模型的文本反馈，动态优化提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，ProRefine比零样本思维链基线高出3到37个百分点。

Conclusion: ProRefine不仅提高准确性，还能让小模型匹配大模型性能，具有高效、可扩展和普及高性能AI的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的LLM遗忘方法，通过约束优化和新型损失函数，有效移除敏感信息同时保留有用数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的LLM需要移除敏感或过时信息，现有方法在遗忘和保留之间难以平衡，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用约束优化问题，使用logit-margin flattening损失函数，结合原始-对偶算法。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中表现优于现有方法，有效移除目标信息且保留下游性能。

Conclusion: 新方法在LLM遗忘任务中高效且稳定，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in real-world settings increasingly
face the need to unlearn sensitive, outdated, or proprietary information.
Existing unlearning methods typically formulate forgetting and retention as a
regularized trade-off, combining both objectives into a single scalarized loss.
This often leads to unstable optimization and degraded performance on retained
data, especially under aggressive forgetting. We propose a new formulation of
LLM unlearning as a constrained optimization problem: forgetting is enforced
via a novel logit-margin flattening loss that explicitly drives the output
distribution toward uniformity on a designated forget set, while retention is
preserved through a hard constraint on a separate retain set. Compared to
entropy-based objectives, our loss is softmax-free, numerically stable, and
maintains non-vanishing gradients, enabling more efficient and robust
optimization. We solve the constrained problem using a scalable primal-dual
algorithm that exposes the trade-off between forgetting and retention through
the dynamics of the dual variable. Evaluations on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks
across diverse LLM architectures demonstrate that our approach consistently
matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines, effectively removing targeted
information while preserving downstream utility.

Motivation: 现有数据集规模小、范围窄，难以全面分析搜索增强语言模型的性能。

Method: 通过众包收集24,000对多轮用户交互数据，包含12,000个人类偏好投票，并进行跨场景分析。

Result: 用户偏好受引用数量和来源影响，社区驱动平台更受欢迎；搜索增强模型在非搜索场景中表现良好，但在搜索场景中依赖参数知识会显著降低质量。

Conclusion: 开源数据集支持未来研究，揭示了搜索增强模型的局限性和改进方向。

Abstract: Search-augmented language models combine web search with Large Language
Models (LLMs) to improve response groundedness and freshness. However,
analyzing these systems remains challenging: existing datasets are limited in
scale and narrow in scope, often constrained to static, single-turn,
fact-checking questions. In this work, we introduce Search Arena, a
crowd-sourced, large-scale, human-preference dataset of over 24,000 paired
multi-turn user interactions with search-augmented LLMs. The dataset spans
diverse intents and languages, and contains full system traces with around
12,000 human preference votes. Our analysis reveals that user preferences are
influenced by the number of citations, even when the cited content does not
directly support the attributed claims, uncovering a gap between perceived and
actual credibility. Furthermore, user preferences vary across cited sources,
revealing that community-driven platforms are generally preferred and static
encyclopedic sources are not always appropriate and reliable. To assess
performance across different settings, we conduct cross-arena analyses by
testing search-augmented LLMs in a general-purpose chat environment and
conventional LLMs in search-intensive settings. We find that web search does
not degrade and may even improve performance in non-search settings; however,
the quality in search settings is significantly affected if solely relying on
the model's parametric knowledge. We open-sourced the dataset to support future
research in this direction. Our dataset and code are available at:

Motivation: 语言模型在人类偏好判断中作为代理，但存在系统性偏差，如过度依赖长度、结构等表面特征，导致奖励破解和不可靠评估。这些偏差源于训练数据中的伪影。

Method: 通过控制反事实对，量化偏好模型对偏差特征的偏好程度，并提出基于反事实数据增强（CDA）的后训练方法。

Result: 偏好模型在60%以上的情况下偏好偏差特征，与人类偏好相比存在40%的校准误差。CDA方法将平均校准误差从39.4%降至32.5%，偏差差异从20.5%降至10.0%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据增强（CDA）能有效减少偏好模型的偏差，提高其可靠性，同时保持整体性能。

Abstract: Language models serve as proxies for human preference judgements in alignment
and evaluation, yet they exhibit systematic miscalibration, prioritizing
superficial patterns over substantive qualities. This bias manifests as
overreliance on features like length, structure, and style, leading to issues
like reward hacking and unreliable evaluations. Evidence suggests these biases
originate in artifacts in human training data. In this work, we systematically
investigate the relationship between training data biases and preference model
miscalibration across five idiosyncratic features of language model
generations: length, structure, jargon, sycophancy and vagueness. Using
controlled counterfactual pairs, we first quantify the extent to which
preference models favor responses with magnified biases (skew), finding this
preference occurs in >60% of instances, and model preferences show high
miscalibration (~40%) compared to human preferences. Notably, bias features
only show mild negative correlations to human preference labels (mean r_human =
-0.12) but show moderately strong positive correlations with labels from a
strong reward model (mean r_model = +0.36), suggesting that models may overrely
on spurious cues. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple post-training
method based on counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) using synthesized
contrastive examples. Finetuning models with CDA reduces average miscalibration
from 39.4% to 32.5% and average absolute skew difference from 20.5% to 10.0%,
while maintaining overall RewardBench performance, showing that targeted
debiasing is effective for building reliable preference models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种异步LLM代理，能够决定何时发言，而不仅仅是内容，并在在线Mafia游戏中表现与人类相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多场景（如群聊、团队会议）是异步的，缺乏明确的轮流发言机制，因此需要LLM代理能够决定何时发言。

Method: 开发了一种自适应异步LLM代理，并收集了在线Mafia游戏数据集进行评测。

Result: 代理在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，发言时机行为与人类相似，但内容存在差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLM在真实人类群体环境中的应用铺平了道路，支持进一步研究异步通信。

Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.

Conclusion: 强调区分行为系统性和表征系统性的重要性，并呼吁未来研究更多关注表征系统性的评估。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法通过均匀采样敏感输入生成隐私合成文本，但在输入数据主题异构时效果不佳，因此需要改进。

Method: 首先对输入数据进行聚类，然后私有计算中位数而非平均值来聚合下一个标记的统计信息，利用中位数局部敏感性较低的优势。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在代表性指标（如MAUVE）和下游任务性能上均有提升，能以更低的隐私成本生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: 通过聚类和私有中位数计算，该方法显著提升了差分隐私语言模型推理的效果，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Urania框架成功实现了隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，适用于LLM交互分析。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM

framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

Abstract: Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting
vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches
often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the
complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of
patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway
modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a
structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model,
EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,
inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs,

behaviors remain. This work focuses on three key aspects: (1) We systematically
analyze the roles of positive and negative samples in RL, revealing that
positive samples mainly facilitate data fitting, whereas negative samples
significantly enhance generalization and robustness. Interestingly, training
solely on negative samples can rival standard RL training performance. (2) We
identify substantial data inefficiency in group relative policy optimization,
where over half of the samples yield zero advantage. To address this, we
explore two straightforward strategies, including relative length rewards and
offline sample injection, to better leverage these data and enhance reasoning
efficiency and capability. (3) We investigate unstable performance across
various reasoning models and benchmarks, attributing instability to uncertain
problems with ambiguous outcomes, and demonstrate that multiple evaluation runs

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，SHARP在全局和度级别上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HAR和SHARP有效缓解了GNN中的度偏差问题，提升了节点分类性能。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often suffer from degree bias in node
classification tasks, where prediction performance varies across nodes with
different degrees. Several approaches, which adopt Graph Contrastive Learning
(GCL), have been proposed to mitigate this bias. However, the limited number of
positive pairs and the equal weighting of all positives and negatives in GCL
still lead to low-degree nodes acquiring insufficient and noisy information.
This paper proposes the Hardness Adaptive Reweighted (HAR) contrastive loss to
mitigate degree bias. It adds more positive pairs by leveraging node labels and
adaptively weights positive and negative pairs based on their learning
hardness. In addition, we develop an experimental framework named SHARP to
extend HAR to a broader range of scenarios. Both our theoretical analysis and
experiments validate the effectiveness of SHARP. The experimental results
across four datasets show that SHARP achieves better performance against
baselines at both global and degree levels.

TL;DR: Diagonal Batching 是一种调度方案，通过并行化 RMTs 中的片段执行，解决了 RMTs 的顺序执行瓶颈，显著提升了长上下文推理的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer 模型在处理长上下文时存在二次时间和线性内存复杂度的问题，RMTs 虽然降低了复杂度，但其顺序执行机制成为性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入 Diagonal Batching，通过重新排序运行时计算，实现片段间的并行化，同时保留精确的递归关系。

Result: 在 LLaMA-1B ARMT 模型上，Diagonal Batching 实现了 3.3 倍的速度提升（相比标准全注意力 LLaMA-1B）和 1.8 倍的速度提升（相比顺序 RMT 实现）。

Conclusion: Diagonal Batching 消除了顺序瓶颈，降低了推理成本和延迟，使 RMTs 成为实际长上下文应用的可行解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer models struggle with long-context inference due to their
quadratic time and linear memory complexity. Recurrent Memory Transformers
(RMTs) offer a solution by reducing the asymptotic cost to linear time and
constant memory usage. However, their memory update mechanism leads to
sequential execution, causing a performance bottleneck.
  We introduce Diagonal Batching, a scheduling scheme that unlocks parallelism
across segments in RMTs while preserving exact recurrence. This approach
eliminates the sequential constraint, enabling efficient GPU inference even for
single long-context inputs without complex batching and pipelining techniques.
Because the technique is purely a run-time computation reordering, existing RMT
models adopt it with no retraining.
  Applied to a LLaMA-1B ARMT model, Diagonal Batching yields a 3.3x speedup
over standard full-attention LLaMA-1B and a 1.8x speedup over the sequential
RMT implementation on 131,072-token sequences. By removing sequential
bottleneck, Diagonal Batching reduces inference cost and latency, thereby
strengthening RMTs as a practical solution for real-world, long-context

Abstract: Sequence modeling is currently dominated by causal transformer architectures
that use softmax self-attention. Although widely adopted, transformers require
scaling memory and compute linearly during inference. A recent stream of work
linearized the softmax operation, resulting in powerful recurrent neural
network (RNN) models with constant memory and compute costs such as DeltaNet,
Mamba or xLSTM. These models can be unified by noting that their recurrent
layer dynamics can all be derived from an in-context regression objective,
approximately optimized through an online learning rule. Here, we join this
line of work and introduce a numerically stable, chunkwise parallelizable
version of the recently proposed Mesa layer (von Oswald et al., 2024), and
study it in language modeling at the billion-parameter scale. This layer again
stems from an in-context loss, but which is now minimized to optimality at
every time point using a fast conjugate gradient solver. Through an extensive
suite of experiments, we show that optimal test-time training enables reaching
lower language modeling perplexity and higher downstream benchmark performance
than previous RNNs, especially on tasks requiring long context understanding.
This performance gain comes at the cost of additional flops spent during

Method: 采用难度导向的在线数据选择和回放机制，通过注意力框架估计问题难度并复用近期数据。

Result: 实验显示，方法在6种LLM-数据集组合中减少25%-65%的训练时间，性能与GRPO相当。

Conclusion: 提出的技术有效提升RL微调的数据效率，显著降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了测试阶段的扩展规律，提出了一种新的Kinetics Scaling Law，强调稀疏注意力的重要性，并展示了其在资源分配和性能提升上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于计算最优性，忽视了推理时策略（如Best-of-N、长链思维）引入的内存访问瓶颈，导致对小模型效果的过高估计。

Method: 通过分析0.6B到32B参数模型，提出Kinetics Scaling Law，结合计算和内存访问成本，并引入稀疏注意力范式以降低单令牌成本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源场景下均优于密集模型，AIME问题解决准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试阶段扩展潜力的关键，因其能持续提升生成效果，而参数扩展在训练阶段已饱和。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

### [219] [Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345)
*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过压缩KV缓存实现推理时超缩放，提升推理准确率而不增加计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer LLMs的推理成本受KV缓存大小限制，而非生成令牌数量，因此探索通过压缩KV缓存提升效率。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），一种新型KV缓存稀疏化方法，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，同时保持高准确率。

Result: 在多个LLM家族中验证了DMS的有效性，例如Qwen-R1 32B在多个基准测试中平均提升9.1分。

Conclusion: DMS通过延迟令牌驱逐和隐式合并表示，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，显著提升了推理准确率。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文讨论了机器学习模型中的系统性（systematicity）问题，强调行为系统性与表示系统性的区别，并分析了现有基准测试的局限性，同时提出了评估表示系统性的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统性是组合性的核心属性，对模型的泛化能力至关重要。然而，现有研究主要关注行为系统性，而忽略了表示系统性，这引发了研究的动机。

Method: 通过分析Hadley（1994）的分类法，评估了语言和视觉领域的关键基准测试对行为系统性的覆盖程度，并借鉴机制可解释性领域的实践，提出了评估表示系统性的方法。

Result: 研究发现现有基准测试主要测试行为系统性，而对表示系统性的评估不足。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁更多关注表示系统性的研究，并提出了评估方法，以推动系统性在机器学习中的更全面理解。

Abstract: A core aspect of compositionality, systematicity is a desirable property in
ML models as it enables strong generalization to novel contexts. This has led
to numerous studies proposing benchmarks to assess systematic generalization,
as well as models and training regimes designed to enhance it. Many of these
efforts are framed as addressing the challenge posed by Fodor and Pylyshyn.
However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing
benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We
emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on
Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to
which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature
across language and vision. Finally, we highlight ways of assessing
systematicity of representations in ML models as practiced in the field of
mechanistic interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法通过均匀采样敏感输入生成差分隐私文本，但会导致生成质量下降，尤其是在输入数据主题异构时。

Method: 通过聚类输入数据选择推理批次，并利用中位数聚合下一个令牌预测，以降低局部敏感性并提升隐私保护效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在代表性和下游任务性能上优于现有方法，且能以更低的隐私成本生成高质量合成数据。

Conclusion: 聚类和中位数聚合的方法显著提升了差分隐私语言模型推理的效果，为生成高质量隐私文本提供了新思路。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) language model inference is an approach for
generating private synthetic text. A sensitive input example is used to prompt
an off-the-shelf large language model (LLM) to produce a similar example.
Multiple examples can be aggregated together to formally satisfy the DP
guarantee.
  Prior work creates inference batches by sampling sensitive inputs uniformly
at random. We show that uniform sampling degrades the quality of privately
generated text, especially when the sensitive examples concern heterogeneous
topics.
  We remedy this problem by clustering the input data before selecting
inference batches. Next, we observe that clustering also leads to more similar
next-token predictions across inferences. We use this insight to introduce a
new algorithm that aggregates next token statistics by privately computing
medians instead of averages. This approach leverages the fact that the median
has decreased local sensitivity when next token predictions are similar,
allowing us to state a data-dependent and ex-post DP guarantee about the
privacy properties of this algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate improvements in
terms of representativeness metrics (e.g., MAUVE) as well as downstream task
performance. We show that our method produces high-quality synthetic data at
significantly lower privacy cost than a previous state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Urania框架成功实现了隐私保护与数据效用的平衡，适用于生成LLM交互的隐私安全见解。

Abstract: We introduce $Urania$, a novel framework for generating insights about LLM
chatbot interactions with rigorous differential privacy (DP) guarantees. The
framework employs a private clustering mechanism and innovative keyword
extraction methods, including frequency-based, TF-IDF-based, and LLM-guided
approaches. By leveraging DP tools such as clustering, partition selection, and
histogram-based summarization, $Urania$ provides end-to-end privacy protection.
Our evaluation assesses lexical and semantic content preservation, pair
similarity, and LLM-based metrics, benchmarking against a non-private
Clio-inspired pipeline (Tamkin et al., 2024). Moreover, we develop a simple
empirical privacy evaluation that demonstrates the enhanced robustness of our
DP pipeline. The results show the framework's ability to extract meaningful
conversational insights while maintaining stringent user privacy, effectively
balancing data utility with privacy preservation.

EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we
introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into
topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models,
while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance
in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming
competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories,

Result: 在6种LLM-数据集组合中，方法将微调时间减少25%至65%，性能与原始GRPO算法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的技术显著提高了RL微调的数据效率，降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning
capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and
existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this
paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL
fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We
introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection,
prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield
informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we
develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small
reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions
is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce
rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism that reuses recent
rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates.
Extensive experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method
reduces RL fine-tuning time by 25% to 65% to reach the same level of
performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了测试时扩展法则，发现小模型的效果被高估，提出了一种新的Kinetics Scaling Law，强调稀疏注意力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于计算最优性，忽略了推理时的内存访问瓶颈，导致小模型效果被高估。

Method: 通过分析0.6B到32B参数模型，提出Kinetics Scaling Law，并引入稀疏注意力降低单令牌成本。

Result: 稀疏注意力模型在低资源和高资源场景下均优于密集模型，AIME问题解决准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: 稀疏注意力是实现测试时扩展潜力的关键，代码已开源。

Abstract: We rethink test-time scaling laws from a practical efficiency perspective,
revealing that the effectiveness of smaller models is significantly
overestimated. Prior work, grounded in compute-optimality, overlooks critical
memory access bottlenecks introduced by inference-time strategies (e.g.,
Best-of-$N$, long CoTs). Our holistic analysis, spanning models from 0.6B to
32B parameters, reveals a new Kinetics Scaling Law that better guides resource
allocation by incorporating both computation and memory access costs. Kinetics
Scaling Law suggests that test-time compute is more effective when used on
models above a threshold than smaller ones. A key reason is that in TTS,
attention, rather than parameter count, emerges as the dominant cost factor.
Motivated by this, we propose a new scaling paradigm centered on sparse
attention, which lowers per-token cost and enables longer generations and more
parallel samples within the same resource budget. Empirically, we show that
sparse attention models consistently outperform dense counterparts, achieving
over 60 points gains in low-cost regimes and over 5 points gains in high-cost
regimes for problem-solving accuracy on AIME, encompassing evaluations on
state-of-the-art MoEs. These results suggest that sparse attention is essential
for realizing the full potential of test-time scaling because, unlike training,
where parameter scaling saturates, test-time accuracy continues to improve
through increased generation. The code is available at

### [230] [Inference-Time Hyper-Scaling with KV Cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05345)
*Adrian Łańcucki,Konrad Staniszewski,Piotr Nawrot,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过压缩键值（KV）缓存实现推理时超扩展，提升推理准确性，同时保持计算预算不变。动态内存稀疏化（DMS）方法在8倍压缩下仍优于无训练的稀疏注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大语言模型（LLM）的推理成本受限于KV缓存大小，而非生成令牌数量。通过压缩KV缓存，可以在相同计算预算下生成更多令牌，提升推理准确性。

Method: 提出动态内存稀疏化（DMS），一种稀疏化KV缓存的新方法，仅需1K训练步骤即可实现8倍压缩，且延迟令牌驱逐以保留关键信息。

Result: 在多种LLM上验证了DMS的有效性，例如在Qwen-R1 32B上，AIME 24、GPQA和LiveCodeBench的准确性分别平均提升9.1、7.6和9.6分。

Conclusion: 推理时超扩展结合DMS方法，显著提升LLM推理准确性，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling trades efficiency for increased reasoning accuracy by
generating longer or more parallel sequences. However, in Transformer LLMs,
generation cost is bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache, rather
than the number of generated tokens. Hence, we explore inference-time
hyper-scaling: by compressing the KV cache, we can generate more tokens within
the same compute budget and further improve the accuracy of scaled inference.
The success of this approach, however, hinges on the ability of compression
methods to preserve accuracy even at high compression ratios. To make
hyper-scaling practical, we introduce Dynamic Memory Sparsification (DMS), a
novel method for sparsifying KV caches that only requires 1K training steps to
achieve 8$\times$ compression, while maintaining better accuracy than
training-free sparse attention. Instead of prematurely discarding cached
tokens, DMS delays token eviction, implicitly merging representations and
preserving critical information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
inference-time hyper-scaling with DMS on multiple families of LLMs, showing
that it boosts accuracy for comparable inference runtime and memory load. For
instance, we enhance Qwen-R1 32B by an average of 9.1 points on AIME 24, 7.6 on
GPQA, and 9.6 on LiveCodeBench across compute budgets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过强化学习框架和显式推理来确保自主代理在决策时保持上下文完整性的方法，显著减少了不适当的信息披露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主代理为用户决策的普及，确保上下文完整性（CI）成为核心问题，即如何在执行任务时适当共享信息。

Method: 首先通过提示LLMs显式推理CI，然后开发强化学习框架进一步训练模型实现CI。使用合成数据集（约700个例子）验证方法。

Result: 方法显著减少了不适当的信息披露，同时保持任务性能，且改进效果可迁移到人类标注的CI基准测试（如PrivacyLens）。

Conclusion: 通过显式推理和强化学习，可以有效提升自主代理在决策时的上下文完整性，减少隐私泄露风险。

Abstract: As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds,
ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to
share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the
field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to
reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first
prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to
disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning
(RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to
achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$
examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show
that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure
while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families.
Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established
CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates
privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for sustainable manufacturing, but
often hallucinate industrial codes and emission factors, undermining regulatory
and investment decisions. We introduce CircuGraphRAG, a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) framework that grounds LLMs outputs in a domain-specific

industrial and waste entities with classification codes and GWP100 emission

translated into SPARQL and verified subgraphs are retrieved to ensure accuracy
and traceability. Compared with Standalone LLMs and Naive RAG, CircuGraphRAG
achieves superior performance in single-hop and multi-hop question answering,
with ROUGE-L F1 scores up to 1.0, while baseline scores below 0.08. It also
improves efficiency, halving the response time and reducing token usage by 16%
in representative tasks. CircuGraphRAG provides fact-checked, regulatory-ready

Abstract: Contemporary approaches to assisted scientific discovery use language models
to automatically generate large numbers of potential hypothesis to test, while
also automatically generating code-based experiments to test those hypotheses.
While hypotheses can be comparatively inexpensive to generate, automated
experiments can be costly, particularly when run at scale (i.e. thousands of
experiments). Developing the capacity to filter hypotheses based on their
feasibility would allow discovery systems to run at scale, while increasing
their likelihood of making significant discoveries. In this work we introduce
Matter-of-Fact, a challenge dataset for determining the feasibility of
hypotheses framed as claims. Matter-of-Fact includes 8.4k claims extracted from
scientific articles spanning four high-impact contemporary materials science
topics, including superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and aerospace
materials, while including qualitative and quantitative claims from
theoretical, experimental, and code/simulation results. We show that strong
baselines that include retrieval augmented generation over scientific
literature and code generation fail to exceed 72% performance on this task
(chance performance is 50%), while domain-expert verification suggests nearly
all are solvable -- highlighting both the difficulty of this task for current
models, and the potential to accelerate scientific discovery by making
near-term progress.

Conclusion: LFS 是一种无需手动调优、适应性强的高效搜索方法，尤其适合复杂任务和强大模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable improvements in
reasoning and planning through increased test-time compute, often by framing
problem-solving as a search process. While methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) have proven effective in some domains, their reliance on fixed
exploration hyperparameters limits their adaptability across tasks of varying
difficulty, rendering them impractical or expensive in certain settings. In
this paper, we propose \textbf{LLM-First Search (LFS)}, a novel \textit{LLM
Self-Guided Search} method that removes the need for pre-defined search
strategies by empowering the LLM to autonomously control the search process via
self-guided exploration. Rather than relying on external heuristics or
hardcoded policies, the LLM evaluates whether to pursue the current search path
or explore alternative branches based on its internal scoring mechanisms. This
enables more flexible and context-sensitive reasoning without requiring manual
tuning or task-specific adaptation. We evaluate LFS on Countdown and Sudoku
against three classic widely-used search algorithms, Tree-of-Thoughts' Breadth
First Search (ToT-BFS), Best First Search (BestFS), and MCTS, each of which
have been used to achieve SotA results on a range of challenging reasoning
tasks. We found that LFS (1) performs better on more challenging tasks without
additional tuning, (2) is more computationally efficient compared to the other
methods, especially when powered by a stronger model, (3) scales better with
stronger models, due to its LLM-First design, and (4) scales better with
increased compute budget. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ReXVQA是胸片视觉问答（VQA）领域最大、最全面的基准测试，包含约69.6万个问题和16万张胸片。它评估了8种多模态大语言模型，其中MedGemma表现最佳（83.24%准确率），并首次在胸片解读上超越人类专家（77.27%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补胸片VQA领域缺乏多样性和临床真实性的空白，推动AI系统模拟专家级临床推理能力。

Method: 引入包含5种核心放射学推理技能的多样化任务，评估8种多模态大语言模型，并进行人类读者研究（3名放射科住院医师）。

Result: MedGemma模型表现最佳（83.24%准确率），首次超越人类专家（77.27%），且人类读者间一致性高，但与AI模型一致性较低。

Conclusion: ReXVQA为评估通用放射学AI系统设定了新标准，并为下一代AI系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present ReXVQA, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual
question answering (VQA) in chest radiology, comprising approximately 696,000
questions paired with 160,000 chest X-rays studies across training, validation,
and test sets. Unlike prior efforts that rely heavily on template based
queries, ReXVQA introduces a diverse and clinically authentic task suite
reflecting five core radiological reasoning skills: presence assessment,
location analysis, negation detection, differential diagnosis, and geometric
reasoning. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art multimodal large language models,
including MedGemma-4B-it, Qwen2.5-VL, Janus-Pro-7B, and Eagle2-9B. The
best-performing model (MedGemma) achieves 83.24% overall accuracy. To bridge
the gap between AI performance and clinical expertise, we conducted a
comprehensive human reader study involving 3 radiology residents on 200
randomly sampled cases. Our evaluation demonstrates that MedGemma achieved
superior performance (83.84% accuracy) compared to human readers (best
radiology resident: 77.27%), representing a significant milestone where AI
performance exceeds expert human evaluation on chest X-ray interpretation. The
reader study reveals distinct performance patterns between AI models and human
experts, with strong inter-reader agreement among radiologists while showing
more variable agreement patterns between human readers and AI models. ReXVQA
establishes a new standard for evaluating generalist radiological AI systems,
offering public leaderboards, fine-grained evaluation splits, structured
explanations, and category-level breakdowns. This benchmark lays the foundation
for next-generation AI systems capable of mimicking expert-level clinical
reasoning beyond narrow pathology classification. Our dataset will be
open-sourced at https://huggingface.co/datasets/rajpurkarlab/ReXVQA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种多模态街道评估框架（MSEF），结合视觉和语言模型，用于评估街道景观的客观和主观感知，并在中国哈尔滨的数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的街道指标无法充分捕捉主观感知，而主观感知对包容性城市设计至关重要。

Method: 研究结合视觉变换器（VisualGLM-6B）和大型语言模型（GPT-4），利用LoRA和P-Tuning v2进行参数高效调整，分析了15,000多张标注的街景图像。

Result: 模型在客观特征上F1得分为0.84，与居民感知的一致性达到89.3%，并揭示了上下文依赖的矛盾和非线性模式。

Conclusion: MSEF为城市感知建模提供了方法创新，并为规划系统提供了实用工具，以平衡基础设施精确性与居民体验。

Abstract: While objective street metrics derived from imagery or GIS have become
standard in urban analytics, they remain insufficient to capture subjective
perceptions essential to inclusive urban design. This study introduces a novel
Multimodal Street Evaluation Framework (MSEF) that fuses a vision transformer
(VisualGLM-6B) with a large language model (GPT-4), enabling interpretable
dual-output assessment of streetscapes. Leveraging over 15,000 annotated
street-view images from Harbin, China, we fine-tune the framework using LoRA
and P-Tuning v2 for parameter-efficient adaptation. The model achieves an F1
score of 0.84 on objective features and 89.3 percent agreement with aggregated
resident perceptions, validated across stratified socioeconomic geographies.
Beyond classification accuracy, MSEF captures context-dependent contradictions:
for instance, informal commerce boosts perceived vibrancy while simultaneously
reducing pedestrian comfort. It also identifies nonlinear and semantically
contingent patterns -- such as the divergent perceptual effects of
architectural transparency across residential and commercial zones -- revealing
the limits of universal spatial heuristics. By generating natural-language
rationales grounded in attention mechanisms, the framework bridges sensory data
with socio-affective inference, enabling transparent diagnostics aligned with
SDG 11. This work offers both methodological innovation in urban perception
modeling and practical utility for planning systems seeking to reconcile
infrastructural precision with lived experience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIVET框架用于系统评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）对物体属性和关系的理解能力，发现当前VLMs在基础属性识别、物体位置依赖和关系理解方面存在局限，且远未达到人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs对场景结构和语义的理解能力，填补缺乏标准化系统评估的空白。

Method: 提出CIVET框架，通过受控刺激系统评估五种先进VLMs的性能。

Result: VLMs仅能识别有限基础属性，性能受物体位置影响，且难以理解物体间关系，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在场景理解方面仍有显著不足，需进一步改进以接近人类能力。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved competitive performance in
various tasks, their comprehension of the underlying structure and semantics of
a scene remains understudied. To investigate the understanding of VLMs, we
study their capability regarding object properties and relations in a
controlled and interpretable manner. To this scope, we introduce CIVET, a novel
and extensible framework for systematiC evaluatIon Via controllEd sTimuli.
CIVET addresses the lack of standardized systematic evaluation for assessing
VLMs' understanding, enabling researchers to test hypotheses with statistical
rigor. With CIVET, we evaluate five state-of-the-art VLMs on exhaustive sets of
stimuli, free from annotation noise, dataset-specific biases, and uncontrolled
scene complexity. Our findings reveal that 1) current VLMs can accurately
recognize only a limited set of basic object properties; 2) their performance
heavily depends on the position of the object in the scene; 3) they struggle to
understand basic relations among objects. Furthermore, a comparative evaluation
with human annotators reveals that VLMs still fall short of achieving
human-level accuracy.

TL;DR: VideoMarathon是一个大规模的长视频指令跟随数据集，包含9,700小时的长视频和3.3M高质量问答对，支持22种任务。基于此，Hour-LLaVA模型通过内存增强模块实现了小时级视频训练和推理，并在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频标注数据稀缺的问题，推动视频大型多模态模型（Video-LMMs）在小时级视频理解上的发展。

Method: 提出VideoMarathon数据集，包含长视频和多样化问答对；开发Hour-LLaVA模型，利用内存增强模块实现高效训练和推理。

Result: Hour-LLaVA在多个长视频语言基准测试中表现最佳，验证了数据集和模型的有效性。

Conclusion: VideoMarathon填补了长视频数据集的空白，Hour-LLaVA为小时级视频理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent long-form video-language understanding benchmarks have driven progress
in video large multimodal models (Video-LMMs). However, the scarcity of
well-annotated long videos has left the training of hour-long Video-LLMs
underexplored. To close this gap, we present VideoMarathon, a large-scale
hour-long video instruction-following dataset. This dataset includes around
9,700 hours of long videos sourced from diverse domains, ranging from 3 to 60
minutes per video. Specifically, it contains 3.3M high-quality QA pairs,
spanning six fundamental topics: temporality, spatiality, object, action,
scene, and event. Compared to existing video instruction datasets,
VideoMarathon significantly extends training video durations up to 1 hour, and
supports 22 diverse tasks requiring both short- and long-term video
comprehension. Building on VideoMarathon, we propose Hour-LLaVA, a powerful and
efficient Video-LMM for hour-scale video-language modeling. It enables
hour-long video training and inference at 1-FPS sampling by leveraging a memory
augmentation module, which adaptively integrates user question-relevant and
spatiotemporal-informative semantics from a cached full video context. In our
experiments, Hour-LLaVA achieves the best performance on multiple long
video-language benchmarks, demonstrating the high quality of the VideoMarathon
dataset and the superiority of the Hour-LLaVA model.
